        "**TREATMENT ARMS SPECIFICATION:**\n"
        "There should be one NCT unique identifier number for a treatment regimen and a publication. Regimen can be a single drug or a combination. Within one publication there can be one arm, two arms, three arms, or even more. Each arm is a separate treatment, whether its monotherapy or combination of two therapies or of three therapies. The ORR, CR or DCR and even all the Safety parameters should be unique to the treatment arm. For eg. NCT 123456789 has 3 treatment arms, first treatment is Drug A + Drug B, second one is Drug B + C, third one is Drug D. Each treatment whether single therapy or combination should have same NCT number within a trial, however can different response rates and safety analysis.\n"
        "If there are more than one publication for one NCT number, extract the data from the most recent one.\n"
        "For eg. if Pembro is a regimen in NCT 12121212 and Pembro is a regimen in NCT 54545454, then list both in separate rows with its unique NCT number.\n\n"
        
        "**FIELD-SPECIFIC EXTRACTION GUIDELINES:**\n\n"
        
        "**Publication name**: Should be listed in order like Name of Journal -Year-Volume-Pages. For eg. NEJM 2017; 377:1345-56. Journal is NEJM, Year is 2017, Volume is 377, Pages are 1345-1356. Name of the journal can be : Lancet, NEJM, JCO and similar.\n\n"
        
        "**NCT Number**: May be mentioned in different ways. For eg. \"This study is completed and was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01515189\" or \"This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01866319\", or \"Clinical trial information: NCT02085070\" or in a similar way within the publication. Extract NCT and every publication should have a NCT number, and no NCT is mentioned dont retrieve any information from that publication.\n\n"
        
        "**Generic Name**: Each Cell in generic name should be a treatment (whether its single, combo or triplet). If its a combo it should be explicitly shown both drugs with a + in middle. The same case for a triplet.\n\n"
        
        "**Stage**: 8 classes only.\n"
        "Stage I, Stage I/II, Stage II, Stage II/III, Stage III, Stage III/ Stage IV, Stage IV.\n\n"
        
        "**Trial name**: If there are multiple arms in one clinical trial, put each treatment in a different row and write the corresponding trial name.\n"
        "If there is only treatment arm use only Treatment arm 1 keywords. If more treatment arms in one publication use arm specific fields accordingly. There can also be same treatment regimen but different doses, for eg. Nivolumab has 3 different doses in the same publication, they should be interpreted as three separate arms. Another eg. One treatment is nivo and other ipilimumab then there should be two treatment arms. Each unique treatment arm should have the corresponding efficacy and safety.\n"
        "Trial name should be listed if it is a \"Keynote\", \"Checkmate\" or Masterkey\". For eg. Kyenote-006. If there is no associated link to these 3 names, then say \"No Name\".\n\n"
        
        "**Cancer type**: Should put only one of these to the associated generic name. 10 classes.\n"
        "Resected Cutaneous Melanoma, Unresectable Cutaneous Melanoma, Cutaneous melanoma with Brain metastasis, Cutaneous Melanoma with CNS metastasis, Uveal Melanoma, Mucosal Melanoma, Acral Melanoma, Basal Cell Carcinoma, Merkel Cell Carcinoma, Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma.\n\n"
        
        "**Line of therapy**: Should put only one of these to the associated generic name. 4 classes.\n"
        "Neoadjuvant, First Line or Untreated  or 2nd Line or 3rd Line+.\n"
        "Important note : 2nd line = include treatments when the 1st treatment failed, 3rd Line+ = include treatments who have failed the 2nd line treatment.\n\n"
        
        "**Efficacy and Safety**:\n"
        "There should be only one corresponding % value for each treatment (there shouldnt be more than 1 value in a cell) with all efficacy and safety sub-parameters like ORR, PFS, Grade 3+ Adverse events and more. In some abstracts, with one NCT number there are multiple arms within it, for eg. a monotherapy, and two combinations. These are part of one clinical trial but treatments are different. Each arm in a clinical trial should be an individual treatment.\n"
        "Capture individual efficacy and safety parameters for each treatment. Cannot show values like (1, 2, 0) in one cell - This could mean there are multiple treatment arms within the trial. Also there shouldn't be any text in the associated value of any of efficacy and safety parameters. Exception: Anywhere the PFS or OS has \"not reached\" or \"NR\" mentioned put \"NR\" as the output in that cell.\n"
        "If the ORR or other parameters are listed as \"n (%) 7 (18); 1 CR 11 (28); 2 CRs 0 (0)\". In that case the result should look like 18%, 28% and 0%, for the corresponding % values ( ).\n\n"
        
        "**Discontinuations**: If there is a statement like \"No treatment discontinuation occurred due to TEAE\", it means the Treatment discontinuation due to TEAE = 0.\n\n"
        
        "**PFS, OS, RFS, EFS, MFS**: values should be in Months (not percentage). For eg. Median PFS maybe listed as 12.0 (8.2â€“17.1) with 12 months being the actual value.\n\n"
        
        "**Total number of patients**: Each treatment should have a specific number of patients being tested in that arm. Dont combine all arms in one clinical trial and sum the patient numbers. We want patient numbers for each arm, corresponding to that particular generic name.\n\n"
        
        "**Research Sponsor**: 2 classes only.\n"
        "Every publication would have keyword such as \"Research sponsor\" or \"Sponsor\" or \"Funded by\" or \"Funding\".\n"
        "If the research sponsor is listed as \"None\" then, it will be given a tagname as \"non Industry-Sponsored\".\n"
        "If the research sponsor is listed as any name of a company or anything except \"none\", it will be given a tagname as \"Industry-Sponsored\".\n\n"
        
        "**p-value for PFS, OS, MFS, EFS, RFS**:\n"
        "Incase for p-value of any survival outcome, list the value corresponding to Non-significant, Significant or Highly Significant. For eg with p>0,05 it should be listed as \"Non-Significant\";  p-value between 0,05 to 0,001 or p<0,001, should be listed as \"Significant\"; p-value for 0,001 and beyond or p<0,0001 should be listed as \"Highly Significant\".\n\n"
