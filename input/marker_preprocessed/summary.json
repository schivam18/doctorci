We present the final protocolspecified survival analysis.**\n\n**Methods In this multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients from 87 academic institutions, hospitals, and cancer centres in 16 countries (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Colombia, France, Germany, Israel, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, UK, and USA). We randomly assigned participants (1:1:1) to one of two dose regimens of pembrolizumab, or one regimen of ipilimumab, using a centralised, computer-generated allocation schedule. Treatment assignments used blocked randomisation within strata. Eligible patients were at least 18 years old, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, at least one measurable lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), unresectable stage III or IV melanoma (excluding ocular melanoma), and up to one previous systemic therapy (excluding anti-CTLA-4, PD-1, or PD-L1 agents). Secondary eligibility criteria are described later. Patients were excluded if they had active brain metastases or active autoimmune disease requiring systemic steroids. The primary outcome was overall survival (defined as the time from randomisation to death from any cause). Response was assessed per RECIST v1.1 by independent central review at week 12, then every 6 weeks up to week 48, and then every 12 weeks thereafter. Survival was assessed every 12 weeks, and final analysis occurred after all patients were followed up for at least 21 months. Primary analysis was done on the intention-to-treat population (all randomly assigned patients) and safety analyses were done in the treated population (all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study treatment). Data cutoff date for this analysis was Dec 3, 2015. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01866319.**\n\n**Findings Between Sept 18, 2013, and March 3, 2014, 834 patients with advanced melanoma were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive intravenous pembrolizumab every 2 weeks (n=279), intravenous pembrolizumab every 3 weeks (n=277), or intravenous ipilimumab every 3 weeks (ipilimumab for four doses; n=278). One patient in the pembrolizumab 2 week group and 22 patients in the ipilimumab group withdrew consent and did not receive treatment. A total of 811 patients received at least one dose of study treatment. Median follow-up was 22\u00b79 months; 383 patients died. Median overall survival was not reached in either pembrolizumab group and was 16\u00b70 months with ipilimumab (hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b768, 95% CI 0\u00b753\u20130\u00b787 for pembrolizumab every 2 weeks** *vs* **ipilimumab; p=0\u00b70009 and 0\u00b768, 0\u00b753\u20130\u00b786 for pembrolizumab every 3 weeks** *vs* **ipilimumab; p=0\u00b70008). 24-month overall survival rate was 55% in the 2-week group, 55% in the 3-week group, and 43% in the ipilimumab group.**\n\n**Interpretation Substantiating the results of the interim analyses of KEYNOTE-006, pembrolizumab continued to provide superior overall survival versus ipilimumab, with no difference between pembrolizumab dosing schedules. These conclusions further support the use of pembrolizumab as a standard of care for advanced melanoma.**\n\n## **Funding Merck & Co.**\n\n# **Introduction**\n\nThe immune system is an effective target in oncology therapy. Checkpoint pathways, including the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte\u2013associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) pathway, which downregulates early T-cell function, and the programmed death 1 (PD-1) pathway, which regulates T-cell activity at the effector phase, can be coopted by tumours to elude an immune response.1 Checkpoint inhibitors restore anti-tumour immune responses, and have become a mainstay in cancer therapy. Several checkpoint inhibitors have been extensively studied, including the anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody ipilimumab and anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies pembrolizumab and nivolumab, all of which are approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma.2\u20134 PD-1 inhibitors are typically associated with better outcomes and fewer grade\n\n#### *Lancet* **2017; 390: 1853\u201362**\n\nPublished **Online** August 16, 2017 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/ S0140-6736(17)31601-X\n\nSee **Comment** page 1816\n\n**Division of Oncology, Ella Lemelbaum Institute for Melanoma, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel**  (J Schachter MD)**; Department of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA** (A Ribas MD)**; Department of Medical Oncology and Translational Research, Melanoma Institute Australia, The University of Sydney, Mater Hospital and Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney, Australia**  (G V Long MD)**; Department of Medical Oncology, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain** (A Arance MD)**; Department of Dermatology and Skin Cancer, Aix Marseille University, H\u00f4pital de la Timone, Marseille, France**  (J Grob MD)**; Department of Dermatology, Universit\u00e9 Lille, INSERM U1189, CHU Lille, F-59000, France** (L Mortier MD)**; Department of Hematology/ Oncology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA**  (A Daud MD)**; Department of Medical Oncology, Westmead and Blacktown Hospitals, Melanoma Institute Australia, and The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia**  (M S Carlino PhD)**; Department of Medical Oncology, Chris O'Brien Lifehouse, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, and Melanoma Institute Australia, Camperdown, Australia**  (C McNeil PhD)**; Department of Melanoma and Cancer Immunotherapy, Sharett Institute of Oncology, Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel** (M Lotem MD)**;** \n\n**Department of Medical Oncology, Royal Marsden Hospital, London, UK**  (J Larkin FRCP)**; Department of Medical Oncology University of Manchester and the Christie NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK**  (P Lorigan FRCP)**; Department of Medical Oncology, Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel, Brussels, Belgium**  (B Neyns MD)**; Department of Medical Oncology, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, Netherlands** (C Blank MD)**; Department of Medicine, Division of Medical Oncology/Hematology, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center, Toronto, ON, Canada**  (T M Petrella MD)**; Department of Hematology/Oncology, The Angeles Clinic and Research Institute, Los Angeles, CA, USA**  (O Hamid MD)**; Departments of Clinical Oncology (SE, NI) and BARDS (HZ), Merck & Co, Kenilworth, NJ, USA**  (H Zhou PhD; S Ebbinghaus MD; N Ibrahim MD)**; Department of Oncology, Gustave Roussy and Paris-Sud University, Villejuif, France** (C Robert MD)\n\nCorrespondence to: Jacob Schachter, The Ella Lemelbaum Institute for Melanoma, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel **jacob.schachter@sheba.health. gov.il**\n\n## **Research in context**\n\n#### **Evidence before this study**\n\nIn August, 2016, we performed an extensive PubMed search for studies of PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 inhibitors in advanced cancer using the primary search terms of \"PD-1 OR PD-L1 OR pembrolizumab OR MK-3475 OR lambrolizumab OR CTLA-4 OR ipilimumab OR nivolumab OR BMS-936558 OR atezolizumab OR MPDL3280A OR durvalumab OR MEDI4763 OR atezolizumab OR MSB0010718C OR BMS-936559.\" Congress abstracts from annual oncology meetings were also included. Our search was not limited by date. The final reference list was generated on the basis of relevance to the scope of this paper.\n\n#### **Added value of this study**\n\nKEYNOTE-006 is the first head-to-head comparison of pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab for advanced melanoma.\n\n3\u20134 treatment-related adverse events than is ipilimumab.5,6 Additional immune checkpoint inhibitors in clinical development for various solid malignancies, including advanced melanoma, include the anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibodies atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab.\n\nKEYNOTE-006 was a randomised, phase 3 trial comparing two dosing schedules of pembrolizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or every 3 weeks) versus ipilimumab (3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses) in patients with ipilimumab-naive unresectable or advanced melanoma. Data from two protocol-specified interim analyses suggested that pembrolizumab provides superior progression-free survival and overall survival compared with ipilimumab, with fewer grade 3\u20135 treatment-related adverse events.6,7 On the basis of these promising results, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expanded the indication of pembrolizumab to include first-line treatment of patients with advanced melanoma regardless of *BRAF*V600 status.3 After the second protocol-specified interim analysis, an external data monitoring committee recommended making pembrolizumab available to patients in KEYNOTE-006 whose disease progressed while in the ipilimumab group, and continuing to follow up all patients for overall survival until the planned final analysis of the study. We present the results of the protocol-specified final analysis to assess long-term survival benefit of pembrolizumab compared with ipilimumab.\n\n# **Methods**\n\n# **Study design**\n\nKEYNOTE-006 was a multi-centre, open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 study done at 87 academic institutions, cancer centres, and hospitals in 16 countries (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Colombia, France, Germany, Israel, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, UK, and USA) and compared pembrolizumab with ipilimumab in patients with Interim analyses reported superiority of pembrolizumab to ipilimumab for overall survival, progression-free survival, and objective response rate, with fewer high-grade treatment-related toxicities with pembrolizumab. Results of the final analysis substantiated the survival advantage of pembrolizumab over ipilimumab and suggested that delayed responses with immunotherapy were possible. Importantly, this study showed that long-term treatment with pembrolizumab is well tolerated and efficacious.\n\n#### **Implications of all the available evidence**\n\nPembrolizumab provides a favourable benefit-risk profile in comparison with ipilimumab, supporting pembrolizumab as a standard of care for advanced melanoma.\n\nipilimumab-naive unresectable or advanced melanoma. The study protocol and all amendments were approved by the institutional review board or independent ethics committee of each participating institution. The trial complied with the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and all local laws and regulations.\n\n## **Participants**\n\nEligible patients were aged at least 18 years, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, at least one measurable lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), unresectable stage III or IV melanoma (excluding ocular melanoma), and up to one previous systemic therapy (excluding anti-CTLA-4, PD-1, or PD-L1 agents). Additional eligibility criteria included known *BRAF* status (previous treatment with BRAF inhibitor therapy was not required for patients with normal lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] and no clinically significant tumour-related symptoms or evidence of rapidly progressing disease), and provision of a tumour sample for determination of PD-L1 status by immunohistochemistry using the 22C3 anti-PD-L1 antibody (Merck & Co, Kenilworth, NJ, USA) at a central laboratory. Patients were excluded if they had active brain metastases (patients with previously-treated stable brain metastases without evidence of progression by magnetic resonance imaging at least 4 weeks before the first dose of pembrolizumab were permitted) or active autoimmune disease requiring systemic steroids. All participants provided written informed consent.\n\n## **Randomisation and masking**\n\nPatients were randomly assigned to receive pembrolizumab or ipilimumab using a centralised, computergenerated allocation schedule. Following patient consent, an interactive voice/web response system (IVRS/IWRS) assigned a unique screening number to each patient. Randomisation was stratified by ECOG performance status (0 *vs* 1), line of therapy (first *vs* second), and PD-L1 status (positive [defined as \u22651% staining in tumour and adjacent immune cells as assessed by immunohistochemistry using the 22C3 antibody] or negative). Treatment assignments used blocked randomisation within strata.\n\n## **Procedures**\n\nPatients were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive intravenous pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 or 3 weeks or intravenous ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for four doses (ipilimumab only). Treatment was given for 2 years (pembrolizumab groups only) or until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, complete response, patient withdrawal of consent, or investigator decision to discontinue treatment. Patients achieving complete response per RECIST v1.1, supported by two scans at least 4 weeks apart, and who received pembrolizumab treatment for at least 6 months were permitted to discontinue treatment. Eligible patients who had disease progression were permitted to remain on treatment until progression was substantiated by imaging at least 4 weeks later.\n\n## **Outcomes**\n\nThe pre-specified primary endpoint at the final analysis was overall survival (defined as the time from randomisation to death from any cause); secondary analyses included progression-free survival (defined as the time from randomisation to first documented progressive disease [based on blinded independent central review using RECIST v1.1] or death from any cause, whichever occurs first), objective response rate (defined as the proportion of the patients in the analysis population who have best response as complete response or partial response), and duration of response (defined as the time from the first documented response to radiologic progression according to RECIST v1.1). Response was assessed per RECIST v1.1 by independent central review at week 12, then every 6 weeks up to week 48, and then every 12 weeks thereafter; clinical decisions were based on investigator-assessed immune-related response criteria (irRC). Survival was assessed every 12 weeks during the survival follow-up phase. Adverse events were recorded throughout the study and for 30 days thereafter (90 days for serious adverse events), and were graded per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Pre-specified immunemediated adverse events (defined as events of unknown cause associated with drug exposure and consistent with an immune event) were recorded throughout the study.\n\n## **Statistical analyses**\n\nThere were two planned interim analyses (first interim analysis data cutoff date: Sep 3, 2014; second interim analysis data cutoff date: Mar 3, 2015), the results of which have been reported.6,7 Although crossover was not allowed per protocol, after the second interim analysis, an external data monitoring committee recommended making pembrolizumab available to patients in KEYNOTE-006 whose disease progressed during treatment with ipilimumab, and continuing to follow all patients for overall survival until the planned final analysis of the study, which was to be done after 435 survival events had occurred or after all patients had at least 21 months of follow-up, whichever occurred first. The primary progression-free analysis was planned for the first interim analysis (after 6 months of follow-up and about 260 progression-free survival events); the study had at least 95% power to detect a true hazard ratio (HR) of 0\u00b75 (comparing each pembrolizumab regimen with ipilimumab), testing each of the two comparisons at \u03b1 of 0\u00b72%, assuming there were 180 progression-free survival events between the pembrolizumab and ipilimumab groups. At the final analysis, the available \u03b1 for testing overall survival was expected to be between 1\u00b75% and 2\u00b70%; with 1% available for each pembrolizumab regimen compared with ipilimumab, there was 85% power to detect a true HR of 0\u00b770, provided 300 deaths were observed in the comparison. These criteria are based on random assignment of about 645 patients across the three treatment groups. In actuality, 834 patients were randomly assigned.\n\nOverall survival, progression-free survival, and objective response rate analyses were done in the intent-to-treat population (all randomised patients); safety analyses were done in the treated population (all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study treatment).\n\nThe Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate overall and progression-free survival and duration of response. Treatment differences in survival were assessed using the stratified log-rank test with the Hochberg procedure,8 using a one-sided \u03b1 of 0\u00b702 as the superiority threshold for overall survival. The Hochberg procedure controlled for multiple testing and for the planned interim analyses; type I error rate was strongly controlled at 2\u00b75% (one-sided). The stratified Cox model9 was used to estimate HRs for progression-free and overall survival, comparing each of the pembrolizumab regimens with ipilimumab, and was used to estimate the HRs for overall survival, comparing the pooled pembrolizumab regimens with ipilimumab within pre-specified subsets of patients. The same stratification factors used for randomisation were applied to the stratified log-rank test and the stratified Cox model. Patients for whom death was not documented at the time of final analysis were censored at the last-known alive date. Treatment differences in objective response rate were assessed using the stratified Miettinen and Nurminen method,10 which was used to calculate the CI for the difference between the proportions. No \u03b1 was pre-specified at the final analysis for supportive analyses. Adverse events were summarised by 6-week periods across treatment groups. Time-adjusted and exposure-adjusted comparisons of safety events were done to adjust for the decreased reporting period for ipilimumab treatment. The cutoff date for the final analysis was Dec 3, 2015. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01866319.\n\n## **Role of funding source**\n\nThe sponsor collaborated jointly with the senior academic authors to design the study and gather, analyse, and interpret the results. The corresponding author had full access to all study data, and all authors had final responsibility for the decision to submit the manuscript for publication.\n\n# **Results**\n\nBetween Sep 18, 2013 and Mar 3, 2014, 834 patients with advanced melanoma were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive pembrolizumab every 2 weeks (n=279), pembrolizumab every 3 weeks (n=277), or ipilimumab every 3 weeks for four doses (ipilimumab only; n=278); 811 received treatment (figure 1). Baseline characteristics were well balanced across treatment groups (table 1). Median age was 62 years and 497 (60%) of 834 patients were male; 270 (32%) of 834 patients had elevated LDH; 302 (36%) of 834 had *BRAF*V600/EK mutations; 671 (80%) of 834 patients had PD-L1-positive tumours; and 549 (66%) of 834 patients had not received previous systemic therapy. Median time on therapy was 28\u00b71 weeks (range 0\u00b71\u2013108\u00b71) for pembrolizumab every 2 weeks, 24\u00b70 weeks (0\u00b71\u2013111\u00b71) for pembrolizumab every 3 weeks, and 9\u00b70 weeks (0\u00b71\u201313\u00b71) for ipilimumab. At final analysis, median follow-up was 22\u00b79 months; per protocol, all patients had been followed up for at least 21 months.\n\nAs of the data cutoff date, treatment was ongoing in 52 (19%) of 279 patients who received pembrolizumab every 2 weeks and in 38 (14%) of 277 patients who received pembrolizumab every 3 weeks; 25 (9%) of 279 patients in the 2-week group and 26 (9%) of 277 patients in the 3-week group completed the protocol-specified maximum 2 years of treatment (figure 1). In the ipilimumab group, 155 (56%) of 278 patients received all four doses of treatment. The most common reasons for discontinuation across treatment groups were progressive disease and adverse events (figure 1). After discontinuing study treatment, more patients given ipilimumab (133 [52%] of 256) started new oncologic therapy than those given pembrolizumab (111 [40%] of 278 patients in the 2-week group and 108 [39%] of 277 patients in the 3-week group); these post-study anti-neoplastic therapies most commonly included immunotherapy (24\u201335%) and BRAF inhibitor or MEK inhibitors (17\u201329%, appendix). Patients receiving pembrolizumab were more likely to receive an anti-CTLA-4 agent post-study (127 [23%] of 555), whereas those who received ipilimumab most commonly received anti-PD-1 therapy (76 [30%] of 256), including 30 patients who received pembrolizumab.\n\nAt the time of data cutoff, 383 patients had died, representing 88% of the target number of events at final analysis (435 deaths). Median overall survival was not\n\n![](_page_3_Figure_9.jpeg)\n\n*Figure 1***: Trial profile**\n\nSee **Online** for appendix\n\nreached in either pembrolizumab group (range 22\u00b71 months\u2013not reached for the 2-week group and 23\u00b75 months\u2013not reached for the 3-week group) and was 16\u00b70 months (range 13\u00b75\u201322\u00b70) for ipilimumab; 24-month overall survival rates were 55% in the 2-week group (95% CI 49\u201361), 55% in the 3-week group (95% CI 49\u201361), and 43% in the ipilimumab group (95% CI 37\u201349; figure 2A). Both pembrolizumab groups were superior to the ipilimumab group (HR 0\u00b768; 95% CI 0\u00b753\u20130\u00b787; p=0\u00b70009 for the 2-week schedule and HR 0\u00b768; 95% CI 0\u00b753\u20130\u00b786; p=0\u00b70008 for the 3-week schedule *vs* ipilimumab; figure 2A). There was no difference between the two pembrolizumab schedules (HR 1\u00b701; p=0\u00b793). Additionally, overall survival was superior in the pooled pembrolizumab groups compared with ipilimumab across subgroups, including in those with typically poor prognosis (eg, patients with elevated LDH and baseline tumour size greater than or equal to the median; figure 3).\n\nOverall, 566 progression-free survival events were reported. 364 (65%) of these 556 events occurred in the pooled pembrolizumab groups. Progression-free survival was longer with pembrolizumab than with ipilimumab (HR 0.61; 95% CI 0\u00b750\u20130\u00b775; p<0\u00b70001 for both pembrolizumab schedules *vs* ipilimumab). There was no difference in progression-free survival between the two pembrolizumab schedules (HR 0.95; 95% CI 0\u00b777\u20131\u00b717; p=0\u00b762). Median progression-free survival was 5\u00b76 months (range 3\u00b74\u20138\u00b72), 4\u00b71 months (range 2\u00b79\u20137\u00b72), and 2\u00b78 months (range 2\u00b78\u20132\u00b79) for pembrolizumab every 2 and 3 weeks and ipilimumab, respectively, with the curves showing a definite separation after the week 12 assessment (figure 2B). Additionally, the 24-month progression-free survival rate was 31% in the 2-week group, 28% in the 3-week group, and 14% in the ipilimumab group.\n\nObjective response was reported in 103 (37%) of 279 patients taking pembrolizumab every 2 weeks, 100 (36%) of 277 patients taking pembrolizumab every 3 weeks, and 37 (13%) of 278 patients taking ipilimumab (table 2). Best overall response was complete response in 33 (12%) of 279 patients in the 2-week group, 36 (13%) of 277 patients in the 3-week group, and 14 (5%) of 278 patients in the ipilimumab group; an additional 30 (11%) of 279 patients in the 2-week group, 30 (11%) of 277 patients in the 3-week group, and 43 (15%) of 278 patients in the ipilimumab group had stable disease. Disease control (complete response plus partial response plus stable disease) was seen in 145 (52%) of 279 patients in the 2-week group and 144 (52%) of 277 patients in the 3-week group and 89 (32%) of 278 patients in the ipilimumab group. Although there were differences in response rate among treatments (p<0\u00b70001 for both pembrolizumab groups compared with ipilimumab), there was no difference between pembrolizumab schedules (p=0\u00b782). At the final analysis, responses (including complete responses) continued to accrue, and\n\n|                                            | Pembrolizumab<br>every 2 weeks n=279 | Pembrolizumab<br>every

Median duration of response was not reached in any treatment group.\n\nOf the 834 patients enrolled, one patient in the pembrolizumab 2-week group and 22 patients in the ipilimumab group withdrew consent and did not receive treatment. A total of 811 patients received at least one dose of study treatment and were included in the safety analysis population. Median time on treatment was 197 days for pembrolizumab every 2 weeks (mean 312 days, SD 260), 168 days for pembrolizumab every 3 weeks (292 days, 264), and 63 days for ipilimumab (50 days, 21). After week 12, almost all patients in the ipilimumab group had completed or discontinued active treatment as planned; consequently, the adverse event reporting period for ipilimumab was shorter than that for pembrolizumab. Any-grade treatment-related adverse events occurred in 229 (82%) of 278 patients in the 2-week group, 213 (77%) of 277 patients in the 3-week group, and 190 (74%) of 256 patients in the ipilimumab group (table 3); most of these treatment-related adverse events were grade 1\u20132. The most common any-grade treatment-related adverse events were fatigue, pruritus, diarrhoea, and rash. Grade 3\u20135 treatment-related toxicities occurred in 47 (17%) of 278 patients in the 2-week group and 46 (17%) of 277 patients in the 3-week group, compared with 50 (20%) of 256 patients in the ipilimumab group (table 3). Most grade 3\u20135 treatment-related adverse events occurred in less than 1% of patients, with the exception of colitis, diarrhoea, fatigue, alanine aminotransferase increase, hypokalemia, and pneumonitis. Treatment-related toxicity resulted in treatment discontination for 19 (7%) of 278 patients in the 2-week group, 30 (11%) of 277 patients in the 3-week group, and 23 (9%) of 256 of patients in the ipilimumab group. Treatment-related adverse events leading to discontinuation that were reported more than once included colitis (three patients) and autoimmune hepatitis (two patients) in the pembrolizumab every 2 weeks group; colitis (four patients), pneumonitis (three patients), hepatitis (two patients), and tubulointerstitial nephritis (two patients) in the pembrolizumab every 3 weeks group; and colitis (nine patients) and diarrhoea (five patients) in the ipilimumab group. One treatment-related death in the pembrolizumab every 2 weeks group was a result of sepsis. Immune-mediated adverse events occurred across treatment groups and most commonly included thyroid disorders (includes hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and thyroiditis) and colitis (appendix). Adverse events were generally managed with supportive care, withholding treatment, or corticosteroid therapy. There were no differences in the overall safety profile between pembrolizumab treatment schedules.\n\nSerious and treatment-related grade 3\u20134 adverse events occurred more frequently in the ipilimumab group than in the pembrolizumab groups in each 6-week reporting\n\nElevated LDH 270 *BRAF*V600E/K wild type\\* 532 *BRAF*V600E/K mutant 302 0 previous therapies 549 1 previous therapy 284 PD-L1 positive 671 PD-L1 negative 150 BTS <median 359\n\nMale 497 Female 337 Age \u226565 years 471 Age <65 years 363 ECOG PS 0 573 ECOG PS 1 261 Normal LDH 547\n\n#### *Figure 3:* **Overall survival in key subgroups**\n\nBTS \u2265median 363\n\nPembrolizumab groups were pooled.

Colitis occurred more frequently in the ipilimumab group, whereas hepatitis and endocrinopathies occurred more frequently in the pembrolizumab group (appendix). 38 (19%) of 202 patients given pembrolizumab for at least 1 year had grade 3\u20134 treatment-related adverse events, nine (4%) of these 202 patients discontinued pembrolizumab because of a treatment-related adverse event, and none died of treatment-related toxicity.\n\n# **Discussion**\n\nKEYNOTE-006 is the first head-to-head comparison of pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab for advanced melanoma. Results of the protocol-specified first and second interim analyses showed that pembrolizumab provided superior progression-free and overall survival, respectively, compared with ipilimumab, with fewer grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events.6,7 The results of this protocol-specified final analysis substantiate the survival advantage for pembrolizumab compared with ipilimumab. The final analysis showed that pembrolizumab treatment resulted in twice the percentage of patients alive and without disease progression compared with ipilimumab (24-month progression-free survival rates of 31% in the pembrolizumab every 2 weeks group, 28% for the pembrolizumab every 3 weeks group, and f14% for the ipilimumab group).\n\nCompared with earlier published results, pembrolizumab continued to provide a greater reduction in risk for death than ipilimumab, with 24-month survival rates approximately 12% higher with pembrolizumab than with ipilimumab. Overall survival for ipilimumab in KEYNOTE-006 is substantially longer than previously reported in other phase 3 studies,11,12 probably because more than half the patients in the ipilimumab group of this study received a subsequent efficacious anticancer therapy, including 76 (30%) of 256 patients who received anti-PD-1 therapy after discontinuation of ipilimumab (appendix). Despite this, we observed a significant improvement in survival with pembrolizumab. Importantly, however, it is difficult to draw strict comparisons about longer term survival with ipilimumab between previously published data and the KEYNOTE-006 study.\n\nResponse rates at the final analysis, which were consistent with the previously published interim data,6,7 remain substantially higher with either pembrolizumab schedule than with ipilimumab, with an approximately three times higher improvement in objective response rate. Most responses were durable and ongoing at the time of data cutoff, regardless of treatment group. Long-term benefit with ipilimumab, including durable responses lasting more than 8 years13,14 and survival of up to 10 years,15 has been reported in patients with advanced melanoma. Here we report durability of response with pembrolizumab and ipilimumab with a 2-year follow-up. Results suggest that the percentage of patients with ongoing response as of the data cutoff date is similar across the three treatment groups.\n\nOur data show that additional objective responses, including complete responses, with pembrolizumab, and to a lesser extent with ipilimumab, can occur after 21 months of follow-up and support the fact that delayed responses or late conversion of partial responses to complete responses are possible with these immunotherapies. Prolonged complete response after pembrolizumab discontinuation was observed in the KEYNOTE-001 study: 59 (97%) of 61 patients maintained response and only two (3%) of 61 patients had progression after 2 years or longer on treatment.16 As patients continue to have long-term benefits after short duration of treatment, questions regarding the optimal duration of treatment should be further investigated.\n\nThe results reported here are similar to those in the phase 3 CheckMate 067 trial in which nivolumab monotherapy provided improved median overall survival (not reached *vs* 20\u00b70 months),17 median progression-free survival (6\u00b79 *vs* 2\u00b79 months),5 and objective response rate (44 *vs* 19%)5 compared with ipilimumab monotherapy in previously untreated patients with advanced melanoma. Differences in eligibility criteria and treatment framework between the two studies might have contributed to the slightly improved responses seen with nivolumab.\n\nIn KEYNOTE-006, more patients given ipilimumab than pembrolizumab went on to receive post-study anti-neoplastic therapy, including anti-PD-1 therapy. The tolerability profile of pembrolizumab makes it a promising candidate for combination therapy, which has the potential to further improve outcomes for patients with advanced melanoma. In the phase 1 KEYNOTE-029 study of standard-dose pembrolizumab with low-dose ipilimumab, combination therapy provided higher objective response rates and improved survival than those historically reported with either therapy alone, but also led to higher rates of toxicity;6,18 as a result, we assessed two additional ipilimumab dosing regimens with standarddose pembrolizumab. Similarly, the combination of lowdose nivolumab with standard-dose ipilimumab led to higher objective response rates and longer progressionfree survival than either therapy alone, but at the expense of higher grade toxicity; as shown by the data that have been reported, the overall survival benefit with the combination was encouraging but not statistically significant.5,19\u201321 Results from phase 1 and phase 2 studies of pembrolizumab in combination with the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 inhibitor epacadostat, or the oncolytic virus talimogene laherparevec, reported an acceptable safety profile and high objective response rates in patients with melanoma;22\u201326 phase 3 trials of these combinations in melanoma are underway.\n\nAlthough first-line therapy with anti-PD-1 antibodies has shown superiority to ipilimumab, and combination therapy with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies appears to improve anti-tumour efficacy, optimal sequencing of these agents has not been established. Arguments exist for first line use of BRAF inhibitors because of the rapid responses often observed with these agents,27,28 whereas other studies support use of immunotherapy as front line treatment since these agents typically result in more durable anti-tumour responses and might have reduced benefit following targeted therapy.29 Retrospective studies suggest that patients might benefit regardless of the treatment sequence.28,30 Of note, a considerable percentage of patients in this study (71 [26%] of 278 patients in the pembrolizumab every 2 weeks group, 48 [17%] of 277 patients in the pembrolizumab every 3 weeks group, and 74 [29%] of 256 patients in the ipilimumab group) received BRAF or MEK targeted therapy following checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Although no additional data are available, analysis of the clinical activity in this subset of patients would be of interest for sequencing discussions. Clearly, the optimal sequencing strategy remains to be elucidated. Questions also remain as to the effect that LDH and other potential prognostic factors might have on sequencing strategy, and appropriate biomarkers to select for those patients most likely to respond to anti-PD-1 therapy.\n\nIn KEYNOTE-006, the prevalence of adverse events and rate of discontinuation for patients receiving pembrolizumab for more than 1 year were similar to those in the overall population, showing that tolerability of pembrolizumab is maintained over time. Additionally, despite a three times longer duration of exposure, pembrolizumab continued to provide a favourable safety profile compared with ipilimumab. As expected from the mechanisms of action of pembrolizumab and ipilimumab,31,32 immune-mediated events occurred across treatment groups. As has been previously reported,33,34 frequency and type of adverse events differed between pembrolizumab and ipilimumab, owing to their unique targets. Notably, and in line with previous findings, colitis was more frequently reported with use of ipilimumab, whereas thyroid disorders were more prevalent with use of pembrolizumab. The number of pembrolizumab and ipilimumab exposure-adjusted adverse events decreased with time, although the decrease was more pronounced in the ipilimumab group, probably because treatment was completed (after four doses) much earlier in the study. Although it is difficult to directly compare the safety profiles because of the difference in reporting periods across the three groups, the average frequency of grade 3-4, serious, and immune-mediated adverse events leading to discontinuation was slightly higher for patients given ipilimumab than those on either pembrolizumab schedule. No new safety signals or increase in adverse event frequency was seen with longer duration of pembrolizumab therapy.\n\nIn conclusion, results of the final analysis from KEYNOTE-006 show that after close to a median of 2 years follow-up, pembrolizumab continues to show a clear and significant superiority compared with ipilimumab for patients with advanced melanoma, and further support the use of pembrolizumab as a standard of care in this patient population.\n\n#### **Contributors**\n\nThe study was conceived, designed, or planned by JS, AD, HZ, SE, and CR.

We present the final protocolspecified survival analysis.**\n\n**Methods In this multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients from 87 academic institutions, hospitals, and cancer centres in 16 countries (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Colombia, France, Germany, Israel, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, UK, and USA). We randomly assigned participants (1:1:1) to one of two dose regimens of pembrolizumab, or one regimen of ipilimumab, using a centralised, computer-generated allocation schedule. Treatment assignments used blocked randomisation within strata. Eligible patients were at least 18 years old, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, at least one measurable lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), unresectable stage III or IV melanoma (excluding ocular melanoma), and up to one previous systemic therapy (excluding anti-CTLA-4, PD-1, or PD-L1 agents). Secondary eligibility criteria are described later. Patients were excluded if they had active brain metastases or active autoimmune disease requiring systemic steroids. The primary outcome was overall survival (defined as the time from randomisation to death from any cause). Response was assessed per RECIST v1.1 by independent central review at week 12, then every 6 weeks up to week 48, and then every 12 weeks thereafter. Survival was assessed every 12 weeks, and final analysis occurred after all patients were followed up for at least 21 months. Primary analysis was done on the intention-to-treat population (all randomly assigned patients) and safety analyses were done in the treated population (all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study treatment). Data cutoff date for this analysis was Dec 3, 2015. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01866319.**\n\n**Findings Between Sept 18, 2013, and March 3, 2014, 834 patients with advanced melanoma were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive intravenous pembrolizumab every 2 weeks (n=279), intravenous pembrolizumab every 3 weeks (n=277), or intravenous ipilimumab every 3 weeks (ipilimumab for four doses; n=278). One patient in the pembrolizumab 2 week group and 22 patients in the ipilimumab group withdrew consent and did not receive treatment. A total of 811 patients received at least one dose of study treatment. Median follow-up was 22\u00b79 months; 383 patients died. Median overall survival was not reached in either pembrolizumab group and was 16\u00b70 months with ipilimumab (hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b768, 95% CI 0\u00b753\u20130\u00b787 for pembrolizumab every 2 weeks** *vs* **ipilimumab; p=0\u00b70009 and 0\u00b768, 0\u00b753\u20130\u00b786 for pembrolizumab every 3 weeks** *vs* **ipilimumab; p=0\u00b70008). 24-month overall survival rate was 55% in the 2-week group, 55% in the 3-week group, and 43% in the ipilimumab group.**\n\n**Interpretation Substantiating the results of the interim analyses of KEYNOTE-006, pembrolizumab continued to provide superior overall survival versus ipilimumab, with no difference between pembrolizumab dosing schedules. These conclusions further support the use of pembrolizumab as a standard of care for advanced melanoma.**\n\n## **Funding Merck & Co.**\n\n# **Introduction**\n\nThe immune system is an effective target in oncology therapy. Checkpoint pathways, including the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte\u2013associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) pathway, which downregulates early T-cell function, and the programmed death 1 (PD-1) pathway, which regulates T-cell activity at the effector phase, can be coopted by tumours to elude an immune response.1 Checkpoint inhibitors restore anti-tumour immune responses, and have become a mainstay in cancer therapy. Several checkpoint inhibitors have been extensively studied, including the anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody ipilimumab and anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies pembrolizumab and nivolumab, all of which are approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma.2\u20134 PD-1 inhibitors are typically associated with better outcomes and fewer grade\n\n#### *Lancet* **2017; 390: 1853\u201362**\n\nPublished **Online** August 16, 2017 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/ S0140-6736(17)31601-X\n\nSee **Comment** page 1816\n\n**Division of Oncology, Ella Lemelbaum Institute for Melanoma, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel**  (J Schachter MD)**; Department of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA** (A Ribas MD)**; Department of Medical Oncology and Translational Research, Melanoma Institute Australia, The University of Sydney, Mater Hospital and Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney, Australia**  (G V Long MD)**; Department of Medical Oncology, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain** (A Arance MD)**; Department of Dermatology and Skin Cancer, Aix Marseille University, H\u00f4pital de la Timone, Marseille, France**  (J Grob MD)**; Department of Dermatology, Universit\u00e9 Lille, INSERM U1189, CHU Lille, F-59000, France** (L Mortier MD)**; Department of Hematology/ Oncology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA**  (A Daud MD)**; Department of Medical Oncology, Westmead and Blacktown Hospitals, Melanoma Institute Australia, and The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia**  (M S Carlino PhD)**; Department of Medical Oncology, Chris O'Brien Lifehouse, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, and Melanoma Institute Australia, Camperdown, Australia**  (C McNeil PhD)**; Department of Melanoma and Cancer Immunotherapy, Sharett Institute of Oncology, Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel** (M Lotem MD)**;** \n\n**Department of Medical Oncology, Royal Marsden Hospital, London, UK**  (J Larkin FRCP)**; Department of Medical Oncology University of Manchester and the Christie NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK**  (P Lorigan FRCP)**; Department of Medical Oncology, Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel, Brussels, Belgium**  (B Neyns MD)**; Department of Medical Oncology, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, Netherlands** (C Blank MD)**; Department of Medicine, Division of Medical Oncology/Hematology, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center, Toronto, ON, Canada**  (T M Petrella MD)**; Department of Hematology/Oncology, The Angeles Clinic and Research Institute, Los Angeles, CA, USA**  (O Hamid MD)**; Departments of Clinical Oncology (SE, NI) and BARDS (HZ), Merck & Co, Kenilworth, NJ, USA**  (H Zhou PhD; S Ebbinghaus MD; N Ibrahim MD)**; Department of Oncology, Gustave Roussy and Paris-Sud University, Villejuif, France** (C Robert MD)\n\nCorrespondence to: Jacob Schachter, The Ella Lemelbaum Institute for Melanoma, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel **jacob.schachter@sheba.health. gov.il**\n\n## **Research in context**\n\n#### **Evidence before this study**\n\nIn August, 2016, we performed an extensive PubMed search for studies of PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 inhibitors in advanced cancer using the primary search terms of \"PD-1 OR PD-L1 OR pembrolizumab OR MK-3475 OR lambrolizumab OR CTLA-4 OR ipilimumab OR nivolumab OR BMS-936558 OR atezolizumab OR MPDL3280A OR durvalumab OR MEDI4763 OR atezolizumab OR MSB0010718C OR BMS-936559.\" Congress abstracts from annual oncology meetings were also included. Our search was not limited by date. The final reference list was generated on the basis of relevance to the scope of this paper.\n\n#### **Added value of this study**\n\nKEYNOTE-006 is the first head-to-head comparison of pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab for advanced melanoma.\n\n3\u20134 treatment-related adverse events than is ipilimumab.5,6 Additional immune checkpoint inhibitors in clinical development for various solid malignancies, including advanced melanoma, include the anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibodies atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab.\n\nKEYNOTE-006 was a randomised, phase 3 trial comparing two dosing schedules of pembrolizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or every 3 weeks) versus ipilimumab (3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses) in patients with ipilimumab-naive unresectable or advanced melanoma. Data from two protocol-specified interim analyses suggested that pembrolizumab provides superior progression-free survival and overall survival compared with ipilimumab, with fewer grade 3\u20135 treatment-related adverse events.6,7 On the basis of these promising results, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expanded the indication of pembrolizumab to include first-line treatment of patients with advanced melanoma regardless of *BRAF*V600 status.3 After the second protocol-specified interim analysis, an external data monitoring committee recommended making pembrolizumab available to patients in KEYNOTE-006 whose disease progressed while in the ipilimumab group, and continuing to follow up all patients for overall survival until the planned final analysis of the study. We present the results of the protocol-specified final analysis to assess long-term survival benefit of pembrolizumab compared with ipilimumab.\n\n# **Methods**\n\n# **Study design**\n\nKEYNOTE-006 was a multi-centre, open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 study done at 87 academic institutions, cancer centres, and hospitals in 16 countries (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Colombia, France, Germany, Israel, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, UK, and USA) and compared pembrolizumab with ipilimumab in patients with Interim analyses reported superiority of pembrolizumab to ipilimumab for overall survival, progression-free survival, and objective response rate, with fewer high-grade treatment-related toxicities with pembrolizumab. Results of the final analysis substantiated the survival advantage of pembrolizumab over ipilimumab and suggested that delayed responses with immunotherapy were possible. Importantly, this study showed that long-term treatment with pembrolizumab is well tolerated and efficacious.\n\n#### **Implications of all the available evidence**\n\nPembrolizumab provides a favourable benefit-risk profile in comparison with ipilimumab, supporting pembrolizumab as a standard of care for advanced melanoma.\n\nipilimumab-naive unresectable or advanced melanoma. The study protocol and all amendments were approved by the institutional review board or independent ethics committee of each participating institution. The trial complied with the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and all local laws and regulations.\n\n## **Participants**\n\nEligible patients were aged at least 18 years, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, at least one measurable lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), unresectable stage III or IV melanoma (excluding ocular melanoma), and up to one previous systemic therapy (excluding anti-CTLA-4, PD-1, or PD-L1 agents). Additional eligibility criteria included known *BRAF* status (previous treatment with BRAF inhibitor therapy was not required for patients with normal lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] and no clinically significant tumour-related symptoms or evidence of rapidly progressing disease), and provision of a tumour sample for determination of PD-L1 status by immunohistochemistry using the 22C3 anti-PD-L1 antibody (Merck & Co, Kenilworth, NJ, USA) at a central laboratory. Patients were excluded if they had active brain metastases (patients with previously-treated stable brain metastases without evidence of progression by magnetic resonance imaging at least 4 weeks before the first dose of pembrolizumab were permitted) or active autoimmune disease requiring systemic steroids. All participants provided written informed consent.\n\n## **Randomisation and masking**\n\nPatients were randomly assigned to receive pembrolizumab or ipilimumab using a centralised, computergenerated allocation schedule. Following patient consent, an interactive voice/web response system (IVRS/IWRS) assigned a unique screening number to each patient. Randomisation was stratified by ECOG performance status (0 *vs* 1), line of therapy (first *vs* second), and PD-L1 status (positive [defined as \u22651% staining in tumour and adjacent immune cells as assessed by immunohistochemistry using the 22C3 antibody] or negative). Treatment assignments used blocked randomisation within strata.\n\n## **Procedures**\n\nPatients were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive intravenous pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 or 3 weeks or intravenous ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for four doses (ipilimumab only). Treatment was given for 2 years (pembrolizumab groups only) or until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, complete response, patient withdrawal of consent, or investigator decision to discontinue treatment. Patients achieving complete response per RECIST v1.1, supported by two scans at least 4 weeks apart, and who received pembrolizumab treatment for at least 6 months were permitted to discontinue treatment. Eligible patients who had disease progression were permitted to remain on treatment until progression was substantiated by imaging at least 4 weeks later.\n\n## **Outcomes**\n\nThe pre-specified primary endpoint at the final analysis was overall survival (defined as the time from randomisation to death from any cause); secondary analyses included progression-free survival (defined as the time from randomisation to first documented progressive disease [based on blinded independent central review using RECIST v1.1] or death from any cause, whichever occurs first), objective response rate (defined as the proportion of the patients in the analysis population who have best response as complete response or partial response), and duration of response (defined as the time from the first documented response to radiologic progression according to RECIST v1.1). Response was assessed per RECIST v1.1 by independent central review at week 12, then every 6 weeks up to week 48, and then every 12 weeks thereafter; clinical decisions were based on investigator-assessed immune-related response criteria (irRC). Survival was assessed every 12 weeks during the survival follow-up phase. Adverse events were recorded throughout the study and for 30 days thereafter (90 days for serious adverse events), and were graded per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Pre-specified immunemediated adverse events (defined as events of unknown cause associated with drug exposure and consistent with an immune event) were recorded throughout the study.\n\n## **Statistical analyses**\n\nThere were two planned interim analyses (first interim analysis data cutoff date: Sep 3, 2014; second interim analysis data cutoff date: Mar 3, 2015), the results of which have been reported.6,7 Although crossover was not allowed per protocol, after the second interim analysis, an external data monitoring committee recommended making pembrolizumab available to patients in KEYNOTE-006 whose disease progressed during treatment with ipilimumab, and continuing to follow all patients for overall survival until the planned final analysis of the study, which was to be done after 435 survival events had occurred or after all patients had at least 21 months of follow-up, whichever occurred first. The primary progression-free analysis was planned for the first interim analysis (after 6 months of follow-up and about 260 progression-free survival events); the study had at least 95% power to detect a true hazard ratio (HR) of 0\u00b75 (comparing each pembrolizumab regimen with ipilimumab), testing each of the two comparisons at \u03b1 of 0\u00b72%, assuming there were 180 progression-free survival events between the pembrolizumab and ipilimumab groups. At the final analysis, the available \u03b1 for testing overall survival was expected to be between 1\u00b75% and 2\u00b70%; with 1% available for each pembrolizumab regimen compared with ipilimumab, there was 85% power to detect a true HR of 0\u00b770, provided 300 deaths were observed in the comparison. These criteria are based on random assignment of about 645 patients across the three treatment groups. In actuality, 834 patients were randomly assigned.\n\nOverall survival, progression-free survival, and objective response rate analyses were done in the intent-to-treat population (all randomised patients); safety analyses were done in the treated population (all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study treatment).\n\nThe Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate overall and progression-free survival and duration of response. Treatment differences in survival were assessed using the stratified log-rank test with the Hochberg procedure,8 using a one-sided \u03b1 of 0\u00b702 as the superiority threshold for overall survival. The Hochberg procedure controlled for multiple testing and for the planned interim analyses; type I error rate was strongly controlled at 2\u00b75% (one-sided). The stratified Cox model9 was used to estimate HRs for progression-free and overall survival, comparing each of the pembrolizumab regimens with ipilimumab, and was used to estimate the HRs for overall survival, comparing the pooled pembrolizumab regimens with ipilimumab within pre-specified subsets of patients. The same stratification factors used for randomisation were applied to the stratified log-rank test and the stratified Cox model. Patients for whom death was not documented at the time of final analysis were censored at the last-known alive date. Treatment differences in objective response rate were assessed using the stratified Miettinen and Nurminen method,10 which was used to calculate the CI for the difference between the proportions. No \u03b1 was pre-specified at the final analysis for supportive analyses. Adverse events were summarised by 6-week periods across treatment groups. Time-adjusted and exposure-adjusted comparisons of safety events were done to adjust for the decreased reporting period for ipilimumab treatment. The cutoff date for the final analysis was Dec 3, 2015. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01866319.\n\n## **Role of funding source**\n\nThe sponsor collaborated jointly with the senior academic authors to design the study and gather, analyse, and interpret the results. The corresponding author had full access to all study data, and all authors had final responsibility for the decision to submit the manuscript for publication.\n\n# **Results**\n\nBetween Sep 18, 2013 and Mar 3, 2014, 834 patients with advanced melanoma were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive pembrolizumab every 2 weeks (n=279), pembrolizumab every 3 weeks (n=277), or ipilimumab every 3 weeks for four doses (ipilimumab only; n=278); 811 received treatment (figure 1). Baseline characteristics were well balanced across treatment groups (table 1). Median age was 62 years and 497 (60%) of 834 patients were male; 270 (32%) of 834 patients had elevated LDH; 302 (36%) of 834 had *BRAF*V600/EK mutations; 671 (80%) of 834 patients had PD-L1-positive tumours; and 549 (66%) of 834 patients had not received previous systemic therapy. Median time on therapy was 28\u00b71 weeks (range 0\u00b71\u2013108\u00b71) for pembrolizumab every 2 weeks, 24\u00b70 weeks (0\u00b71\u2013111\u00b71) for pembrolizumab every 3 weeks, and 9\u00b70 weeks (0\u00b71\u201313\u00b71) for ipilimumab. At final analysis, median follow-up was 22\u00b79 months; per protocol, all patients had been followed up for at least 21 months.\n\nAs of the data cutoff date, treatment was ongoing in 52 (19%) of 279 patients who received pembrolizumab every 2 weeks and in 38 (14%) of 277 patients who received pembrolizumab every 3 weeks; 25 (9%) of 279 patients in the 2-week group and 26 (9%) of 277 patients in the 3-week group completed the protocol-specified maximum 2 years of treatment (figure 1). In the ipilimumab group, 155 (56%) of 278 patients received all four doses of treatment. The most common reasons for discontinuation across treatment groups were progressive disease and adverse events (figure 1). After discontinuing study treatment, more patients given ipilimumab (133 [52%] of 256) started new oncologic therapy than those given pembrolizumab (111 [40%] of 278 patients in the 2-week group and 108 [39%] of 277 patients in the 3-week group); these post-study anti-neoplastic therapies most commonly included immunotherapy (24\u201335%) and BRAF inhibitor or MEK inhibitors (17\u201329%, appendix). Patients receiving pembrolizumab were more likely to receive an anti-CTLA-4 agent post-study (127 [23%] of 555), whereas those who received ipilimumab most commonly received anti-PD-1 therapy (76 [30%] of 256), including 30 patients who received pembrolizumab.\n\nAt the time of data cutoff, 383 patients had died, representing 88% of the target number of events at final analysis (435 deaths). Median overall survival was not\n\n![](_page_3_Figure_9.jpeg)\n\n*Figure 1***: Trial profile**\n\nSee **Online** for appendix\n\nreached in either pembrolizumab group (range 22\u00b71 months\u2013not reached for the 2-week group and 23\u00b75 months\u2013not reached for the 3-week group) and was 16\u00b70 months (range 13\u00b75\u201322\u00b70) for ipilimumab; 24-month overall survival rates were 55% in the 2-week group (95% CI 49\u201361), 55% in the 3-week group (95% CI 49\u201361), and 43% in the ipilimumab group (95% CI 37\u201349; figure 2A). Both pembrolizumab groups were superior to the ipilimumab group (HR 0\u00b768; 95% CI 0\u00b753\u20130\u00b787; p=0\u00b70009 for the 2-week schedule and HR 0\u00b768; 95% CI 0\u00b753\u20130\u00b786; p=0\u00b70008 for the 3-week schedule *vs* ipilimumab; figure 2A). There was no difference between the two pembrolizumab schedules (HR 1\u00b701; p=0\u00b793). Additionally, overall survival was superior in the pooled pembrolizumab groups compared with ipilimumab across subgroups, including in those with typically poor prognosis (eg, patients with elevated LDH and baseline tumour size greater than or equal to the median; figure 3).\n\nOverall, 566 progression-free survival events were reported. 364 (65%) of these 556 events occurred in the pooled pembrolizumab groups. Progression-free survival was longer with pembrolizumab than with ipilimumab (HR 0.61; 95% CI 0\u00b750\u20130\u00b775; p<0\u00b70001 for both pembrolizumab schedules *vs* ipilimumab). There was no difference in progression-free survival between the two pembrolizumab schedules (HR 0.95; 95% CI 0\u00b777\u20131\u00b717; p=0\u00b762). Median progression-free survival was 5\u00b76 months (range 3\u00b74\u20138\u00b72), 4\u00b71 months (range 2\u00b79\u20137\u00b72), and 2\u00b78 months (range 2\u00b78\u20132\u00b79) for pembrolizumab every 2 and 3 weeks and ipilimumab, respectively, with the curves showing a definite separation after the week 12 assessment (figure 2B). Additionally, the 24-month progression-free survival rate was 31% in the 2-week group, 28% in the 3-week group, and 14% in the ipilimumab group.\n\nObjective response was reported in 103 (37%) of 279 patients taking pembrolizumab every 2 weeks, 100 (36%) of 277 patients taking pembrolizumab every 3 weeks, and 37 (13%) of 278 patients taking ipilimumab (table 2). Best overall response was complete response in 33 (12%) of 279 patients in the 2-week group, 36 (13%) of 277 patients in the 3-week group, and 14 (5%) of 278 patients in the ipilimumab group; an additional 30 (11%) of 279 patients in the 2-week group, 30 (11%) of 277 patients in the 3-week group, and 43 (15%) of 278 patients in the ipilimumab group had stable disease. Disease control (complete response plus partial response plus stable disease) was seen in 145 (52%) of 279 patients in the 2-week group and 144 (52%) of 277 patients in the 3-week group and 89 (32%) of 278 patients in the ipilimumab group. Although there were differences in response rate among treatments (p<0\u00b70001 for both pembrolizumab groups compared with ipilimumab), there was no difference between pembrolizumab schedules (p=0\u00b782). At the final analysis, responses (including complete responses) continued to accrue, and\n\n|                                            | Pembrolizumab<br>every 2 weeks n=279 | Pembrolizumab<br>every

Median duration of response was not reached in any treatment group.\n\nOf the 834 patients enrolled, one patient in the pembrolizumab 2-week group and 22 patients in the ipilimumab group withdrew consent and did not receive treatment. A total of 811 patients received at least one dose of study treatment and were included in the safety analysis population. Median time on treatment was 197 days for pembrolizumab every 2 weeks (mean 312 days, SD 260), 168 days for pembrolizumab every 3 weeks (292 days, 264), and 63 days for ipilimumab (50 days, 21). After week 12, almost all patients in the ipilimumab group had completed or discontinued active treatment as planned; consequently, the adverse event reporting period for ipilimumab was shorter than that for pembrolizumab. Any-grade treatment-related adverse events occurred in 229 (82%) of 278 patients in the 2-week group, 213 (77%) of 277 patients in the 3-week group, and 190 (74%) of 256 patients in the ipilimumab group (table 3); most of these treatment-related adverse events were grade 1\u20132. The most common any-grade treatment-related adverse events were fatigue, pruritus, diarrhoea, and rash. Grade 3\u20135 treatment-related toxicities occurred in 47 (17%) of 278 patients in the 2-week group and 46 (17%) of 277 patients in the 3-week group, compared with 50 (20%) of 256 patients in the ipilimumab group (table 3). Most grade 3\u20135 treatment-related adverse events occurred in less than 1% of patients, with the exception of colitis, diarrhoea, fatigue, alanine aminotransferase increase, hypokalemia, and pneumonitis. Treatment-related toxicity resulted in treatment discontination for 19 (7%) of 278 patients in the 2-week group, 30 (11%) of 277 patients in the 3-week group, and 23 (9%) of 256 of patients in the ipilimumab group. Treatment-related adverse events leading to discontinuation that were reported more than once included colitis (three patients) and autoimmune hepatitis (two patients) in the pembrolizumab every 2 weeks group; colitis (four patients), pneumonitis (three patients), hepatitis (two patients), and tubulointerstitial nephritis (two patients) in the pembrolizumab every 3 weeks group; and colitis (nine patients) and diarrhoea (five patients) in the ipilimumab group. One treatment-related death in the pembrolizumab every 2 weeks group was a result of sepsis. Immune-mediated adverse events occurred across treatment groups and most commonly included thyroid disorders (includes hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and thyroiditis) and colitis (appendix). Adverse events were generally managed with supportive care, withholding treatment, or corticosteroid therapy. There were no differences in the overall safety profile between pembrolizumab treatment schedules.\n\nSerious and treatment-related grade 3\u20134 adverse events occurred more frequently in the ipilimumab group than in the pembrolizumab groups in each 6-week reporting\n\nElevated LDH 270 *BRAF*V600E/K wild type\\* 532 *BRAF*V600E/K mutant 302 0 previous therapies 549 1 previous therapy 284 PD-L1 positive 671 PD-L1 negative 150 BTS <median 359\n\nMale 497 Female 337 Age \u226565 years 471 Age <65 years 363 ECOG PS 0 573 ECOG PS 1 261 Normal LDH 547\n\n#### *Figure 3:* **Overall survival in key subgroups**\n\nBTS \u2265median 363\n\nPembrolizumab groups were pooled.

Colitis occurred more frequently in the ipilimumab group, whereas hepatitis and endocrinopathies occurred more frequently in the pembrolizumab group (appendix). 38 (19%) of 202 patients given pembrolizumab for at least 1 year had grade 3\u20134 treatment-related adverse events, nine (4%) of these 202 patients discontinued pembrolizumab because of a treatment-related adverse event, and none died of treatment-related toxicity.\n\n# **Discussion**\n\nKEYNOTE-006 is the first head-to-head comparison of pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab for advanced melanoma. Results of the protocol-specified first and second interim analyses showed that pembrolizumab provided superior progression-free and overall survival, respectively, compared with ipilimumab, with fewer grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events.6,7 The results of this protocol-specified final analysis substantiate the survival advantage for pembrolizumab compared with ipilimumab. The final analysis showed that pembrolizumab treatment resulted in twice the percentage of patients alive and without disease progression compared with ipilimumab (24-month progression-free survival rates of 31% in the pembrolizumab every 2 weeks group, 28% for the pembrolizumab every 3 weeks group, and f14% for the ipilimumab group).\n\nCompared with earlier published results, pembrolizumab continued to provide a greater reduction in risk for death than ipilimumab, with 24-month survival rates approximately 12% higher with pembrolizumab than with ipilimumab. Overall survival for ipilimumab in KEYNOTE-006 is substantially longer than previously reported in other phase 3 studies,11,12 probably because more than half the patients in the ipilimumab group of this study received a subsequent efficacious anticancer therapy, including 76 (30%) of 256 patients who received anti-PD-1 therapy after discontinuation of ipilimumab (appendix). Despite this, we observed a significant improvement in survival with pembrolizumab. Importantly, however, it is difficult to draw strict comparisons about longer term survival with ipilimumab between previously published data and the KEYNOTE-006 study.\n\nResponse rates at the final analysis, which were consistent with the previously published interim data,6,7 remain substantially higher with either pembrolizumab schedule than with ipilimumab, with an approximately three times higher improvement in objective response rate. Most responses were durable and ongoing at the time of data cutoff, regardless of treatment group. Long-term benefit with ipilimumab, including durable responses lasting more than 8 years13,14 and survival of up to 10 years,15 has been reported in patients with advanced melanoma. Here we report durability of response with pembrolizumab and ipilimumab with a 2-year follow-up. Results suggest that the percentage of patients with ongoing response as of the data cutoff date is similar across the three treatment groups.\n\nOur data show that additional objective responses, including complete responses, with pembrolizumab, and to a lesser extent with ipilimumab, can occur after 21 months of follow-up and support the fact that delayed responses or late conversion of partial responses to complete responses are possible with these immunotherapies. Prolonged complete response after pembrolizumab discontinuation was observed in the KEYNOTE-001 study: 59 (97%) of 61 patients maintained response and only two (3%) of 61 patients had progression after 2 years or longer on treatment.16 As patients continue to have long-term benefits after short duration of treatment, questions regarding the optimal duration of treatment should be further investigated.\n\nThe results reported here are similar to those in the phase 3 CheckMate 067 trial in which nivolumab monotherapy provided improved median overall survival (not reached *vs* 20\u00b70 months),17 median progression-free survival (6\u00b79 *vs* 2\u00b79 months),5 and objective response rate (44 *vs* 19%)5 compared with ipilimumab monotherapy in previously untreated patients with advanced melanoma. Differences in eligibility criteria and treatment framework between the two studies might have contributed to the slightly improved responses seen with nivolumab.\n\nIn KEYNOTE-006, more patients given ipilimumab than pembrolizumab went on to receive post-study anti-neoplastic therapy, including anti-PD-1 therapy. The tolerability profile of pembrolizumab makes it a promising candidate for combination therapy, which has the potential to further improve outcomes for patients with advanced melanoma. In the phase 1 KEYNOTE-029 study of standard-dose pembrolizumab with low-dose ipilimumab, combination therapy provided higher objective response rates and improved survival than those historically reported with either therapy alone, but also led to higher rates of toxicity;6,18 as a result, we assessed two additional ipilimumab dosing regimens with standarddose pembrolizumab. Similarly, the combination of lowdose nivolumab with standard-dose ipilimumab led to higher objective response rates and longer progressionfree survival than either therapy alone, but at the expense of higher grade toxicity; as shown by the data that have been reported, the overall survival benefit with the combination was encouraging but not statistically significant.5,19\u201321 Results from phase 1 and phase 2 studies of pembrolizumab in combination with the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 inhibitor epacadostat, or the oncolytic virus talimogene laherparevec, reported an acceptable safety profile and high objective response rates in patients with melanoma;22\u201326 phase 3 trials of these combinations in melanoma are underway.\n\nAlthough first-line therapy with anti-PD-1 antibodies has shown superiority to ipilimumab, and combination therapy with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies appears to improve anti-tumour efficacy, optimal sequencing of these agents has not been established. Arguments exist for first line use of BRAF inhibitors because of the rapid responses often observed with these agents,27,28 whereas other studies support use of immunotherapy as front line treatment since these agents typically result in more durable anti-tumour responses and might have reduced benefit following targeted therapy.29 Retrospective studies suggest that patients might benefit regardless of the treatment sequence.28,30 Of note, a considerable percentage of patients in this study (71 [26%] of 278 patients in the pembrolizumab every 2 weeks group, 48 [17%] of 277 patients in the pembrolizumab every 3 weeks group, and 74 [29%] of 256 patients in the ipilimumab group) received BRAF or MEK targeted therapy following checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Although no additional data are available, analysis of the clinical activity in this subset of patients would be of interest for sequencing discussions. Clearly, the optimal sequencing strategy remains to be elucidated. Questions also remain as to the effect that LDH and other potential prognostic factors might have on sequencing strategy, and appropriate biomarkers to select for those patients most likely to respond to anti-PD-1 therapy.\n\nIn KEYNOTE-006, the prevalence of adverse events and rate of discontinuation for patients receiving pembrolizumab for more than 1 year were similar to those in the overall population, showing that tolerability of pembrolizumab is maintained over time. Additionally, despite a three times longer duration of exposure, pembrolizumab continued to provide a favourable safety profile compared with ipilimumab. As expected from the mechanisms of action of pembrolizumab and ipilimumab,31,32 immune-mediated events occurred across treatment groups. As has been previously reported,33,34 frequency and type of adverse events differed between pembrolizumab and ipilimumab, owing to their unique targets. Notably, and in line with previous findings, colitis was more frequently reported with use of ipilimumab, whereas thyroid disorders were more prevalent with use of pembrolizumab. The number of pembrolizumab and ipilimumab exposure-adjusted adverse events decreased with time, although the decrease was more pronounced in the ipilimumab group, probably because treatment was completed (after four doses) much earlier in the study. Although it is difficult to directly compare the safety profiles because of the difference in reporting periods across the three groups, the average frequency of grade 3-4, serious, and immune-mediated adverse events leading to discontinuation was slightly higher for patients given ipilimumab than those on either pembrolizumab schedule. No new safety signals or increase in adverse event frequency was seen with longer duration of pembrolizumab therapy.\n\nIn conclusion, results of the final analysis from KEYNOTE-006 show that after close to a median of 2 years follow-up, pembrolizumab continues to show a clear and significant superiority compared with ipilimumab for patients with advanced melanoma, and further support the use of pembrolizumab as a standard of care in this patient population.\n\n#### **Contributors**\n\nThe study was conceived, designed, or planned by JS, AD, HZ, SE, and CR.

Ascierto, M.D.\n\n## ABSTRACT\n\n#### **BACKGROUND**\n\nNivolumab was associated with higher rates of objective response than chemotherapy in a phase 3 study involving patients with ipilimumab-refractory metastatic melanoma. The use of nivolumab in previously untreated patients with advanced melanoma has not been tested in a phase 3 controlled study.\n\n#### **METHODS**\n\nWe randomly assigned 418 previously untreated patients who had metastatic melanoma without a *BRAF* mutation to receive nivolumab (at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks and dacarbazine-matched placebo every 3 weeks) or dacarbazine (at a dose of 1000 mg per square meter of body-surface area every 3 weeks and nivolumab-matched placebo every 2 weeks). The primary end point was overall survival.\n\n#### **RESULTS**\n\nAt 1 year, the overall rate of survival was 72.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 65.5 to 78.9) in the nivolumab group, as compared with 42.1% (95% CI, 33.0 to 50.9) in the dacarbazine group (hazard ratio for death, 0.42; 99.79% CI, 0.25 to 0.73; P<0.001). The median progression-free survival was 5.1 months in the nivolumab group versus 2.2 months in the dacarbazine group (hazard ratio for death or progression of disease, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.56; P<0.001). The objective response rate was 40.0% (95% CI, 33.3 to 47.0) in the nivolumab group versus 13.9% (95% CI, 9.5 to 19.4) in the dacarbazine group (odds ratio, 4.06; P<0.001). The survival benefit with nivolumab versus dacarbazine was observed across prespecified subgroups, including subgroups defined by status regarding the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Common adverse events associated with nivolumab included fatigue, pruritus, and nausea. Drugrelated adverse events of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 11.7% of the patients treated with nivolumab and 17.6% of those treated with dacarbazine.\n\n#### **CONCLUSIONS**\n\nNivolumab was associated with significant improvements in overall survival and progression-free survival, as compared with dacarbazine, among previously untreated patients who had metastatic melanoma without a *BRAF* mutation.

For personal use only.\n\nThe global incidence of melanoma continues to rise, and the mortality associated with unresectable or metastatic melanoma remains high.1 Globally, 132,000 new cases of melanoma are diagnosed and an estimated 48,000 persons die from advanced melanoma each year.2,3 Ipilimumab has been shown to improve the rate of survival at 2 years, as compared with a vaccine control, among previously treated patients with metastatic melanoma as well as among previously untreated patients who also received dacarbazine.4,5 BRAF and MEK inhibitors are approved agents that, as monotherapy, have been associated with a survival advantage as compared with chemotherapy, with a median overall survival of 13 to 20 months.6-8 Although the objective response rate is high with these agents (45 to 53%), the median duration of response is less than 1 year.6-10\n\nRecently, a combination of anti-BRAF and anti-MEK agents has been associated with a higher response rate and longer duration of response, as compared with anti-BRAF monotherapies.11,12 However, the use of these targeted agents, as monotherapy or in combination, is limited to the approximately 40% of patients who have melanoma with a *BRAF* V600 mutation. Dacarbazine is associated with a median overall survival of 5.6 to 7.8 months and remained until recently a commonly used therapy in patients with previously untreated melanoma without a *BRAF* mutation.5,13 Despite new treatment options, there remains a substantial unmet need for treatments that extend survival and provide a better quality of life.\n\nNivolumab is a fully human IgG4 programmed death 1 (PD-1) immune-checkpoint\u2013 inhibitor antibody that selectively blocks the interaction of the PD-1 receptor with its two known programmed death ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, disrupting the negative signal that regulates T-cell activation and proliferation.14 In a phase 1 study, nivolumab was associated with promising antitumor activity and a favorable safety profile in patients with solid tumors, including advanced melanoma.15,16 In an open-label, randomized, phase 3 study involving patients with ipilimumab-refractory melanoma, nivolumab was associated with a higher rate of objective response than chemotherapy (32% vs. 11%).17 Recently, another anti\u2013PD-1 antibody, pembrolizumab, has shown robust clinical activity and has been approved in the United States on the basis of an objective response rate of 24% among patients with advanced melanoma that progressed after ipilimumab, as well as treatment with a BRAF inhibitor if the patient had a *BRAF* V600 mutation.18 Here, we report the results of a phase 3, randomized, double-blind study conducted to determine whether nivolumab, as compared with dacarbazine, improves overall survival among previously untreated patients who have advanced melanoma without a *BRAF* mutation.\n\n## METHODS\n\n### **PATIENTS**\n\nEligible patients had confirmed, unresectable, previously untreated stage III or IV melanoma without a *BRAF* mutation. Other eligibility criteria included an age of 18 years or more, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance-status score of 0 or 1 (on a scale of 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no symptoms and 1 indicating mild symptoms), and the availability of tumor tissue from a metastatic or unresectable site for PD-L1 biomarker analysis. Key exclusion criteria were active brain metastases, uveal melanoma, and a history of serious autoimmune disease. Patients who had received adjuvant therapy previously were not excluded.\n\n#### **STUDY DESIGN AND TREATMENT**\n\nPatients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive by means of intravenous infusion either 3 mg of nivolumab per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks, plus a dacarbazine-matched placebo every 3 weeks, or 1000 mg of dacarbazine per square meter of body-surface area every 3 weeks, plus a nivolumab-matched placebo every 2 weeks. Randomization was stratified according to tumor PD-L1 status (positive vs. negative or indeterminate) and metastasis stage (M0, M1a, or M1b vs. M1c, defined according to the tumor\u2013node\u2013metastasis system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer and the International Union against Cancer). Treatment continued until there was disease progression, as assessed by the investigator, or an unacceptable level of toxic effects. Treatment after disease progression was permitted for patients who had a clinical benefit and did not have substantial adverse effects with the study drug, as determined by the investigator (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary\n\nn engl j med 372;4 nejm.org january 22, 2015 321\n\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.

For personal use only.\n\nAppendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org).\n\nThe primary end point was overall survival. Secondary end points included investigator-assessed progression-free survival, objective response rate, and PD-L1 expression in the tumor as a predictive biomarker of overall survival.\n\n## **ASSESSMENT**\n\nTumor response was assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1,19 at 9 weeks after randomization, every 6 weeks thereafter for the first year, and then every 12 weeks until disease progression or treatment discontinuation. Assessments for survival were performed every 3 months. Safety evaluations were performed for patients who received at least one dose of the study treatment, and the severity of adverse events was graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0.<sup>20</sup>\n\n#### **STUDY OVERSIGHT**\n\nThe study protocol, available at NEJM.org with the most recent version of the statistical analysis plan, was approved by the institutional review board at each participating center. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. All the patients provided written informed consent to participate in the study. Data were collected by the sponsor, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and analyzed in collaboration with the academic authors. All the authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and analyses reported and for the fidelity of the study to the protocol. The first draft of the manuscript was written by the first and last authors, with all the authors contributing to subsequent drafts. Medical-writing support, funded by the sponsor, was provided by StemScientific.\n\nA data and safety monitoring committee was established to provide oversight of safety and efficacy considerations. On June 10, 2014, the monitoring committee reviewed an expedited report after noting a potential difference in overall survival during an earlier safety review. Data from the abbreviated report, which was based on an unplanned interim database lock, showed a significant difference in overall survival in favor of nivolumab. As a result, the monitoring committee recommended that the study be unblinded and amended to allow patients enrolled in the dacarbazine group to receive nivolumab. Reported here are the results from the double-blind portion of the study before the amendment (clinical data cutoff on June 24, 2014).\n\n### **PD-L1 ASSESSMENT**\n\nBefore randomization, the expression of PD-L1 on the surface of the tumor cells was assessed in a central laboratory with the use of an automated immunohistochemical assay (collaboratively developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Dako), as described previously.21 PD-L1 positivity was defined as at least 5% of tumor cells showing cell-surface PD-L1 staining of any intensity in a section containing at least 100 tumor cells that could be evaluated. Indeterminate status was attributed to samples for which tumor cell\u2013surface expression could not be discerned because of melanin content or strong cytoplasmic staining. PD-L1 status was prospectively determined, and the results were used to stratify randomization, which was performed by means of a fully automated interactive voiceresponse system. Statistical analyses were prespecified to assess the predictive value of PD-L1 expression.\n\n#### **STATISTICAL ANALYSIS**\n\nA sample of approximately 410 patients, randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the two treatment groups, was planned. Overall survival and progression-free survival were compared between the two treatment groups with the use of a twosided log-rank test stratified according to PD-L1 status (positive vs. negative or indeterminate) and metastasis stage (M0, M1a, or M1b vs. M1c). The hazard ratios for the nivolumab group, as compared with the dacarbazine group, and corresponding confidence intervals were estimated with the use of a stratified Cox proportionalhazards model. Survival curves for each treatment group were estimated with the use of the Kaplan\u2013Meier product-limit method. Rates at fixed time points were derived from the Kaplan\u2013Meier estimate, along with their corresponding log-log\u2013transformed 95% confidence interval.\n\nThe objective response rate was compared between the two treatment groups with the use of a two-sided Cochran\u2013Mantel\u2013Haenszel test. The efficacy analyses were performed in the\n\nDownloaded from nejm.org at Chalmers Tekniska Hogskola on June 16, 2025.

The safety analyses were performed in the population of patients who received at least one dose of a study drug. At the time of data analysis, 146 patients had died. The boundary for statistical significance, which was based on the Lan\u2013 DeMets alpha-spending function with O'Brien and Fleming\u2013type boundaries, required the logrank P value to be less than 0.0021, corresponding to a 99.79% confidence interval.\n\n## RESULTS\n\n### **PATIENTS AND TREATMENT**\n\nFrom January 2013 through February 2014, a total of 518 patients were enrolled at 80 centers in Europe, Israel, Australia, Canada, and South America. A total of 418 patients underwent randomization: 210 patients were assigned to the nivolumab group and 208 to the dacarbazine group (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). One patient randomly assigned to the nivolumab group and 3 randomly assigned to the dacarbazine group were inadvertently enrolled in the study, despite having an ECOG performance-status score of 2; 1 additional patient in the nivolumab group did not report an ECOG performancestatus score. Baseline characteristics were balanced between the two groups. A total of 61.0% of patients had stage M1c disease, 36.6% had an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level, and 35.4% had a positive PD-L1 status (Table 1).\n\nAt the time of the database lock, 95 of 206 patients (46.1%) treated with nivolumab and 13 of 205 (6.3%) treated with dacarbazine were continuing the study treatment. The most frequent reason for discontinuation was disease progression, in 96 of 206 patients (46.6%) in the nivolumab group and 175 of 205 (85.4%) in the dacarbazine group (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). After the discontinuation of study treatment, 63 of 210 patients (30.0%) in the nivolumab group and 114 of 208 (54.8%) in the dacarbazine group received systemic therapy, most commonly ipilimumab (in 45 of 63 patients and 79 of 114, respectively) (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). All the patients who underwent randomization were followed for up to 16.7 months at the time of database lock on August 5, 2014, which was 5.2 months after the first visit of the last patient who had undergone randomization.\n\n#### **EFFICACY**\n\nThe median overall survival was not reached in the nivolumab group and was 10.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.3 to 12.1) in the dacarbazine group. The overall survival rate at 1 year was 72.9% (95% CI, 65.5 to 78.9) in the nivolumab group and 42.1% (95% CI, 33.0 to 50.9) in the dacarbazine group. A significant benefit with respect to overall survival was observed in the nivolumab group, as compared with the dacarbazine group (hazard ratio for death, 0.42; 99.79% CI, 0.25 to 0.73; P<0.001) (Fig. 1A).\n\nThe median progression-free survival was 5.1 months (95% CI, 3.5 to 10.8) in the nivolumab group and 2.2 months (95% CI, 2.1 to 2.4) in the dacarbazine group (Fig. 1B). A significant benefit with respect to progression-free survival was observed in the nivolumab group, as compared with the dacarbazine group (hazard ratio for death or progression of disease, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.56; P<0.001).\n\nThe objective response rate in the nivolumab group was 40.0% (95% CI, 33.3 to 47.0), which was significantly higher than the rate in the dacarbazine group, which was 13.9% (95% CI, 9.5 to 19.4) (odds ratio, 4.06; P<0.001). The percentage of patients with a complete response was higher with nivolumab than with dacarbazine (7.6% vs. 1.0%) (Fig. 2 and Table 2). Among patients who had a response, the median duration of response was not reached in the nivolumab group and was 6.0 months in the dacarbazine group (95% CI, 3.0 to not reached) (Fig. 2C).\n\nIn the nivolumab group, a reduction of 30% or more in the tumor burden in the target lesion, representing an unconventional response pattern sometimes seen with immunotherapies, was achieved or maintained in 17 of 54 patients who were treated beyond progression (8.1% of patients randomly assigned to nivolumab) (Fig. S4A in the Supplementary Appendix). In the dacarbazine group, this unconventional response was achieved or maintained in 8 of the 49 patients who were treated beyond progression (3.8% of patients randomly assigned to dacarbazine) (Fig. S4B in the Supplementary Appendix).\n\n### **SUBGROUP ANALYSES**\n\nRegardless of PD-L1 status, nivolumab-treated patients had improved overall survival, as compared with dacarbazine-treated patients (unadjusted hazard ratio for death among patients with positive PD-L1 status, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.15 to\n\nn engl j med 372;4 nejm.org january 22, 2015 323\n\n| Table 1.

In the nivolumab group, the median overall survival was not reached in either PD-L1 subgroup. In the dacarbazine group, the median overall survival was slightly longer in the subgroup with positive PD-L1 status than in the subgroup with negative or indeterminate PD-L1 status (12.4 vs. 10.2 months) (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).\n\nIn the two PD-L1 subgroups, nivolumabtreated patients had improved rates of objective response, as compared with dacarbazine-treated patients. In the subgroup with positive PD-L1 status, the objective response rate was 52.7% (95% CI, 40.8 to 64.3) in the nivolumab group versus 10.8% (95% CI, 4.8 to 20.2) in the dacarbazine group. In the subgroup with negative or indeterminate PD-L1 status, the objective response rate was 33.1% (95% CI, 25.2 to 41.7) in the nivolumab group versus 15.7% (95% CI, 10.0 to 23.0) in the dacarbazine group. The survival benefit with nivolumab versus dacarbazine was also observed across prespecified subgroups based on age, sex, metastasis stage, ECOG performance-status score, status with respect to a history of brain metastases, baseline lactate dehydrogenase level, and geographic region (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).\n\n#### **ADVERSE EVENTS**\n\nThe incidence of treatment-related adverse events of any grade was similar in the nivolumab group and the dacarbazine group (74.3% and 75.6%, respectively). However, treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were reported less frequently in the nivolumab group than in the dacarbazine group (11.7% vs. 17.6%) (Table 3, and Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The most common adverse events related to nivolumab treatment were fatigue (in 19.9% of patients), pruritus (in 17.0%), and nausea (in 16.5%). In the dacarbazine group, common treatment-related adverse events were consistent with those in previous reports and included gastrointestinal and hematologic toxic events.

Characteristics of Response.**\n\nThe waterfall plots show the maximum change from baseline in the sum of the reference diameters of the target lesion in patients receiving nivolumab (Panel A) and those receiving dacarbazine (Panel B). Data are shown for all the patients who had a response that could be evaluated in the target lesion at baseline and who underwent at least one tumor assessment during treatment. The percentage increase was truncated at 100% (red squares). Red dots indicate patients who had a response to treatment according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1. The dashed lines in Panels A and B indicate a 30% reduction in the tumor burden in the target lesion. Kaplan\u2013 Meier curves for the duration of response (Panel C) show that the median duration of response in the 84 patients in the nivolumab group who had a response was not reached; 12 of these patients did not have a durable response. Of the 29 patients in the dacarbazine group who had a response, 14 did not have a durable response. The dashed line in Panel C indicates the median duration of response.\n\nor 4 selected adverse events that were considered to be related to nivolumab treatment were infrequent and included diarrhea and an elevated alanine aminotransferase level (each in 1.0% of patients) (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). The majority of selected adverse events of grade 3 or 4 resolved quickly with a delay in the study treatment, glucocorticoid administration, or both, as recommended in the safety management guidelines for nivolumab (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nThis phase 3, double-blind, randomized, controlled study showed an overall survival benefit with nivolumab, an anti\u2013PD-1 antibody. The risk of death decreased by 58% with nivolumab, as compared with dacarbazine, among previously untreated patients with advanced melanoma. The survival benefit was consistent across all the prespecified subgroups, including patients with poor prognostic factors.\n\nThe 1-year survival rate associated with nivolumab in this study (73%) is consistent with the results in a phase 1 study15,16,22 and was significantly higher than the rate associated with dacarbazine.

The calculation of the confidence interval was based on the Clopper\u2013Pearson method. The estimate of the difference (the rate in the nivolumab group minus the rate in the dacarbazine group) was based on the Cochran\u2013Mantel\u2013Haenszel method of weighting, with adjustment for PD-L1 status and metastasis stage as entered into the interactive voice-response system. The odds ratio and twosided P value for an objective response with nivolumab as compared with dacarbazine were calculated with the use of a Cochran\u2013Mantel\u2013Haenszel test stratified according to PD-L1 status and metastasis stage.\n\n\u00a7 The median was calculated with the use of the Kaplan\u2013Meier method. Data were censored for the range values because the observations are ongoing. The cutoff date for clinical data was August 5, 2014, with a range of follow-up from 5.2 to 16.7 months.\n\nmutation. In this group of patients, only ipilimumab in combination with dacarbazine has been associated with a survival benefit, as compared with dacarbazine alone, in a phase 3, controlled trial.5 When the present study was planned in 2012, ipilimumab had not been approved for use as a first-line treatment for advanced melanoma in most regions outside the United States. However, during the course of this study, it was approved for first-line therapy in most regions. Nevertheless, dacarbazine is still used as a firstline therapy for metastatic melanoma in many countries.\n\nAn additional phase 3 study (CheckMate 067; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01844505), evaluating both nivolumab monotherapy and combination therapy with nivolumab plus ipilimumab, as compared with ipilimumab alone, in previously untreated patients with melanoma is currently under way. The activity of ipilimumab is probably reflected in the performance of the dacarbazine group in the present study. The median survival in the dacarbazine group (10.8 months) in this study is higher than that previously reported,5 possibly because 38% of the dacarbazine-treated patients received ipilimumab after stopping the study treatment.\n\nThe objective response rate (40%) and duration of response associated with nivolumab that were observed in this study are in line with\n\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.

These results are in agreement with the long-term follow-up data from a phase 1 study of nivolumab, which showed a median duration of response of almost 2 years and an objective response rate of 32% among patients with advanced melanoma.<sup>22</sup>\n\nThe response rate with a BRAF or MEK inhibitor was recently surpassed by new combination regimens in patients with a *BRAF* V600 mutation11,12; however, for patients who have melanoma without a *BRAF* mutation, treatment options beyond ipilimumab are limited. Although the target population of our study was restricted to patients with melanoma who did not have a *BRAF* mutation, previous studies have shown that nivolumab had similar clinical activity regardless of the patient's *BRAF* mutation status.17,24\n\nPrevious studies, which have used various methodologic approaches, have shown a correlation between PD-L1 expression and objective response in patients with metastatic melanoma treated with anti\u2013PD-1 or anti\u2013PD-L1 antibodies.21,22,24-28 In our study, given the magnitude of the clinical benefit observed in patients receiving nivolumab versus those receiving dacarbazine, PD-L1 status alone, as assessed with the use of the methods presented here, does not\n\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\n\nDownloaded from nejm.org at Chalmers Tekniska Hogskola on June 16, 2025.

Also, because there was little difference in median overall survival between the two subgroups of dacarbazine-treated patients defined according to PD-L1 status (positive vs. negative or indeterminate), the prognostic role of PD-L1 status remains to be determined.\n\nThe safety profile of nivolumab in this study was similar to that observed previously.15-17,22 The frequency of selected adverse events with a potential immunologic cause was similar to the frequency observed in a previous phase 3 trial,17 and the events resolved in the majority of our patients.\n\nIn conclusion, nivolumab was associated with a significant improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival, as compared with dacarbazine.

The use of nivolumab in previously untreated patients with advanced melanoma has not been tested in a phase 3 controlled study.\n\n#### **METHODS**\n\nWe randomly assigned 418 previously untreated patients who had metastatic melanoma without a *BRAF* mutation to receive nivolumab (at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks and dacarbazine-matched placebo every 3 weeks) or dacarbazine (at a dose of 1000 mg per square meter of body-surface area every 3 weeks and nivolumab-matched placebo every 2 weeks). The primary end point was overall survival.\n\n#### **RESULTS**\n\nAt 1 year, the overall rate of survival was 72.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 65.5 to 78.9) in the nivolumab group, as compared with 42.1% (95% CI, 33.0 to 50.9) in the dacarbazine group (hazard ratio for death, 0.42; 99.79% CI, 0.25 to 0.73; P<0.001). The median progression-free survival was 5.1 months in the nivolumab group versus 2.2 months in the dacarbazine group (hazard ratio for death or progression of disease, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.56; P<0.001). The objective response rate was 40.0% (95% CI, 33.3 to 47.0) in the nivolumab group versus 13.9% (95% CI, 9.5 to 19.4) in the dacarbazine group (odds ratio, 4.06; P<0.001). The survival benefit with nivolumab versus dacarbazine was observed across prespecified subgroups, including subgroups defined by status regarding the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Common adverse events associated with nivolumab included fatigue, pruritus, and nausea. Drugrelated adverse events of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 11.7% of the patients treated with nivolumab and 17.6% of those treated with dacarbazine.\n\n#### **CONCLUSIONS**\n\nNivolumab was associated with significant improvements in overall survival and progression-free survival, as compared with dacarbazine, among previously untreated patients who had metastatic melanoma without a *BRAF* mutation.

For personal use only.\n\nThe global incidence of melanoma continues to rise, and the mortality associated with unresectable or metastatic melanoma remains high.1 Globally, 132,000 new cases of melanoma are diagnosed and an estimated 48,000 persons die from advanced melanoma each year.2,3 Ipilimumab has been shown to improve the rate of survival at 2 years, as compared with a vaccine control, among previously treated patients with metastatic melanoma as well as among previously untreated patients who also received dacarbazine.4,5 BRAF and MEK inhibitors are approved agents that, as monotherapy, have been associated with a survival advantage as compared with chemotherapy, with a median overall survival of 13 to 20 months.6-8 Although the objective response rate is high with these agents (45 to 53%), the median duration of response is less than 1 year.6-10\n\nRecently, a combination of anti-BRAF and anti-MEK agents has been associated with a higher response rate and longer duration of response, as compared with anti-BRAF monotherapies.11,12 However, the use of these targeted agents, as monotherapy or in combination, is limited to the approximately 40% of patients who have melanoma with a *BRAF* V600 mutation. Dacarbazine is associated with a median overall survival of 5.6 to 7.8 months and remained until recently a commonly used therapy in patients with previously untreated melanoma without a *BRAF* mutation.5,13 Despite new treatment options, there remains a substantial unmet need for treatments that extend survival and provide a better quality of life.\n\nNivolumab is a fully human IgG4 programmed death 1 (PD-1) immune-checkpoint\u2013 inhibitor antibody that selectively blocks the interaction of the PD-1 receptor with its two known programmed death ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, disrupting the negative signal that regulates T-cell activation and proliferation.14 In a phase 1 study, nivolumab was associated with promising antitumor activity and a favorable safety profile in patients with solid tumors, including advanced melanoma.15,16 In an open-label, randomized, phase 3 study involving patients with ipilimumab-refractory melanoma, nivolumab was associated with a higher rate of objective response than chemotherapy (32% vs. 11%).17 Recently, another anti\u2013PD-1 antibody, pembrolizumab, has shown robust clinical activity and has been approved in the United States on the basis of an objective response rate of 24% among patients with advanced melanoma that progressed after ipilimumab, as well as treatment with a BRAF inhibitor if the patient had a *BRAF* V600 mutation.18 Here, we report the results of a phase 3, randomized, double-blind study conducted to determine whether nivolumab, as compared with dacarbazine, improves overall survival among previously untreated patients who have advanced melanoma without a *BRAF* mutation.\n\n## METHODS\n\n### **PATIENTS**\n\nEligible patients had confirmed, unresectable, previously untreated stage III or IV melanoma without a *BRAF* mutation. Other eligibility criteria included an age of 18 years or more, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance-status score of 0 or 1 (on a scale of 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no symptoms and 1 indicating mild symptoms), and the availability of tumor tissue from a metastatic or unresectable site for PD-L1 biomarker analysis. Key exclusion criteria were active brain metastases, uveal melanoma, and a history of serious autoimmune disease. Patients who had received adjuvant therapy previously were not excluded.\n\n#### **STUDY DESIGN AND TREATMENT**\n\nPatients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive by means of intravenous infusion either 3 mg of nivolumab per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks, plus a dacarbazine-matched placebo every 3 weeks, or 1000 mg of dacarbazine per square meter of body-surface area every 3 weeks, plus a nivolumab-matched placebo every 2 weeks. Randomization was stratified according to tumor PD-L1 status (positive vs. negative or indeterminate) and metastasis stage (M0, M1a, or M1b vs. M1c, defined according to the tumor\u2013node\u2013metastasis system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer and the International Union against Cancer). Treatment continued until there was disease progression, as assessed by the investigator, or an unacceptable level of toxic effects. Treatment after disease progression was permitted for patients who had a clinical benefit and did not have substantial adverse effects with the study drug, as determined by the investigator (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary\n\nn engl j med 372;4 nejm.org january 22, 2015 321\n\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.

Secondary end points included investigator-assessed progression-free survival, objective response rate, and PD-L1 expression in the tumor as a predictive biomarker of overall survival.\n\n## **ASSESSMENT**\n\nTumor response was assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1,19 at 9 weeks after randomization, every 6 weeks thereafter for the first year, and then every 12 weeks until disease progression or treatment discontinuation. Assessments for survival were performed every 3 months. Safety evaluations were performed for patients who received at least one dose of the study treatment, and the severity of adverse events was graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0.<sup>20</sup>\n\n#### **STUDY OVERSIGHT**\n\nThe study protocol, available at NEJM.org with the most recent version of the statistical analysis plan, was approved by the institutional review board at each participating center. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. All the patients provided written informed consent to participate in the study. Data were collected by the sponsor, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and analyzed in collaboration with the academic authors. All the authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and analyses reported and for the fidelity of the study to the protocol. The first draft of the manuscript was written by the first and last authors, with all the authors contributing to subsequent drafts. Medical-writing support, funded by the sponsor, was provided by StemScientific.\n\nA data and safety monitoring committee was established to provide oversight of safety and efficacy considerations. On June 10, 2014, the monitoring committee reviewed an expedited report after noting a potential difference in overall survival during an earlier safety review. Data from the abbreviated report, which was based on an unplanned interim database lock, showed a significant difference in overall survival in favor of nivolumab. As a result, the monitoring committee recommended that the study be unblinded and amended to allow patients enrolled in the dacarbazine group to receive nivolumab. Reported here are the results from the double-blind portion of the study before the amendment (clinical data cutoff on June 24, 2014).\n\n### **PD-L1 ASSESSMENT**\n\nBefore randomization, the expression of PD-L1 on the surface of the tumor cells was assessed in a central laboratory with the use of an automated immunohistochemical assay (collaboratively developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Dako), as described previously.21 PD-L1 positivity was defined as at least 5% of tumor cells showing cell-surface PD-L1 staining of any intensity in a section containing at least 100 tumor cells that could be evaluated. Indeterminate status was attributed to samples for which tumor cell\u2013surface expression could not be discerned because of melanin content or strong cytoplasmic staining. PD-L1 status was prospectively determined, and the results were used to stratify randomization, which was performed by means of a fully automated interactive voiceresponse system. Statistical analyses were prespecified to assess the predictive value of PD-L1 expression.\n\n#### **STATISTICAL ANALYSIS**\n\nA sample of approximately 410 patients, randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the two treatment groups, was planned. Overall survival and progression-free survival were compared between the two treatment groups with the use of a twosided log-rank test stratified according to PD-L1 status (positive vs. negative or indeterminate) and metastasis stage (M0, M1a, or M1b vs. M1c). The hazard ratios for the nivolumab group, as compared with the dacarbazine group, and corresponding confidence intervals were estimated with the use of a stratified Cox proportionalhazards model. Survival curves for each treatment group were estimated with the use of the Kaplan\u2013Meier product-limit method. Rates at fixed time points were derived from the Kaplan\u2013Meier estimate, along with their corresponding log-log\u2013transformed 95% confidence interval.\n\nThe objective response rate was compared between the two treatment groups with the use of a two-sided Cochran\u2013Mantel\u2013Haenszel test. The efficacy analyses were performed in the\n\nDownloaded from nejm.org at Chalmers Tekniska Hogskola on June 16, 2025.

The safety analyses were performed in the population of patients who received at least one dose of a study drug. At the time of data analysis, 146 patients had died. The boundary for statistical significance, which was based on the Lan\u2013 DeMets alpha-spending function with O'Brien and Fleming\u2013type boundaries, required the logrank P value to be less than 0.0021, corresponding to a 99.79% confidence interval.\n\n## RESULTS\n\n### **PATIENTS AND TREATMENT**\n\nFrom January 2013 through February 2014, a total of 518 patients were enrolled at 80 centers in Europe, Israel, Australia, Canada, and South America. A total of 418 patients underwent randomization: 210 patients were assigned to the nivolumab group and 208 to the dacarbazine group (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). One patient randomly assigned to the nivolumab group and 3 randomly assigned to the dacarbazine group were inadvertently enrolled in the study, despite having an ECOG performance-status score of 2; 1 additional patient in the nivolumab group did not report an ECOG performancestatus score. Baseline characteristics were balanced between the two groups. A total of 61.0% of patients had stage M1c disease, 36.6% had an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level, and 35.4% had a positive PD-L1 status (Table 1).\n\nAt the time of the database lock, 95 of 206 patients (46.1%) treated with nivolumab and 13 of 205 (6.3%) treated with dacarbazine were continuing the study treatment. The most frequent reason for discontinuation was disease progression, in 96 of 206 patients (46.6%) in the nivolumab group and 175 of 205 (85.4%) in the dacarbazine group (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). After the discontinuation of study treatment, 63 of 210 patients (30.0%) in the nivolumab group and 114 of 208 (54.8%) in the dacarbazine group received systemic therapy, most commonly ipilimumab (in 45 of 63 patients and 79 of 114, respectively) (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). All the patients who underwent randomization were followed for up to 16.7 months at the time of database lock on August 5, 2014, which was 5.2 months after the first visit of the last patient who had undergone randomization.\n\n#### **EFFICACY**\n\nThe median overall survival was not reached in the nivolumab group and was 10.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.3 to 12.1) in the dacarbazine group. The overall survival rate at 1 year was 72.9% (95% CI, 65.5 to 78.9) in the nivolumab group and 42.1% (95% CI, 33.0 to 50.9) in the dacarbazine group. A significant benefit with respect to overall survival was observed in the nivolumab group, as compared with the dacarbazine group (hazard ratio for death, 0.42; 99.79% CI, 0.25 to 0.73; P<0.001) (Fig. 1A).\n\nThe median progression-free survival was 5.1 months (95% CI, 3.5 to 10.8) in the nivolumab group and 2.2 months (95% CI, 2.1 to 2.4) in the dacarbazine group (Fig. 1B). A significant benefit with respect to progression-free survival was observed in the nivolumab group, as compared with the dacarbazine group (hazard ratio for death or progression of disease, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.56; P<0.001).\n\nThe objective response rate in the nivolumab group was 40.0% (95% CI, 33.3 to 47.0), which was significantly higher than the rate in the dacarbazine group, which was 13.9% (95% CI, 9.5 to 19.4) (odds ratio, 4.06; P<0.001). The percentage of patients with a complete response was higher with nivolumab than with dacarbazine (7.6% vs. 1.0%) (Fig. 2 and Table 2). Among patients who had a response, the median duration of response was not reached in the nivolumab group and was 6.0 months in the dacarbazine group (95% CI, 3.0 to not reached) (Fig. 2C).\n\nIn the nivolumab group, a reduction of 30% or more in the tumor burden in the target lesion, representing an unconventional response pattern sometimes seen with immunotherapies, was achieved or maintained in 17 of 54 patients who were treated beyond progression (8.1% of patients randomly assigned to nivolumab) (Fig. S4A in the Supplementary Appendix).

In the nivolumab group, the median overall survival was not reached in either PD-L1 subgroup. In the dacarbazine group, the median overall survival was slightly longer in the subgroup with positive PD-L1 status than in the subgroup with negative or indeterminate PD-L1 status (12.4 vs. 10.2 months) (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).\n\nIn the two PD-L1 subgroups, nivolumabtreated patients had improved rates of objective response, as compared with dacarbazine-treated patients. In the subgroup with positive PD-L1 status, the objective response rate was 52.7% (95% CI, 40.8 to 64.3) in the nivolumab group versus 10.8% (95% CI, 4.8 to 20.2) in the dacarbazine group. In the subgroup with negative or indeterminate PD-L1 status, the objective response rate was 33.1% (95% CI, 25.2 to 41.7) in the nivolumab group versus 15.7% (95% CI, 10.0 to 23.0) in the dacarbazine group. The survival benefit with nivolumab versus dacarbazine was also observed across prespecified subgroups based on age, sex, metastasis stage, ECOG performance-status score, status with respect to a history of brain metastases, baseline lactate dehydrogenase level, and geographic region (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).\n\n#### **ADVERSE EVENTS**\n\nThe incidence of treatment-related adverse events of any grade was similar in the nivolumab group and the dacarbazine group (74.3% and 75.6%, respectively). However, treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were reported less frequently in the nivolumab group than in the dacarbazine group (11.7% vs. 17.6%) (Table 3, and Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The most common adverse events related to nivolumab treatment were fatigue (in 19.9% of patients), pruritus (in 17.0%), and nausea (in 16.5%). In the dacarbazine group, common treatment-related adverse events were consistent with those in previous reports and included gastrointestinal and hematologic toxic events.

Characteristics of Response.**\n\nThe waterfall plots show the maximum change from baseline in the sum of the reference diameters of the target lesion in patients receiving nivolumab (Panel A) and those receiving dacarbazine (Panel B). Data are shown for all the patients who had a response that could be evaluated in the target lesion at baseline and who underwent at least one tumor assessment during treatment. The percentage increase was truncated at 100% (red squares). Red dots indicate patients who had a response to treatment according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1. The dashed lines in Panels A and B indicate a 30% reduction in the tumor burden in the target lesion. Kaplan\u2013 Meier curves for the duration of response (Panel C) show that the median duration of response in the 84 patients in the nivolumab group who had a response was not reached; 12 of these patients did not have a durable response. Of the 29 patients in the dacarbazine group who had a response, 14 did not have a durable response. The dashed line in Panel C indicates the median duration of response.\n\nor 4 selected adverse events that were considered to be related to nivolumab treatment were infrequent and included diarrhea and an elevated alanine aminotransferase level (each in 1.0% of patients) (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). The majority of selected adverse events of grade 3 or 4 resolved quickly with a delay in the study treatment, glucocorticoid administration, or both, as recommended in the safety management guidelines for nivolumab (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nThis phase 3, double-blind, randomized, controlled study showed an overall survival benefit with nivolumab, an anti\u2013PD-1 antibody. The risk of death decreased by 58% with nivolumab, as compared with dacarbazine, among previously untreated patients with advanced melanoma. The survival benefit was consistent across all the prespecified subgroups, including patients with poor prognostic factors.\n\nThe 1-year survival rate associated with nivolumab in this study (73%) is consistent with the results in a phase 1 study15,16,22 and was significantly higher than the rate associated with dacarbazine.

The calculation of the confidence interval was based on the Clopper\u2013Pearson method. The estimate of the difference (the rate in the nivolumab group minus the rate in the dacarbazine group) was based on the Cochran\u2013Mantel\u2013Haenszel method of weighting, with adjustment for PD-L1 status and metastasis stage as entered into the interactive voice-response system. The odds ratio and twosided P value for an objective response with nivolumab as compared with dacarbazine were calculated with the use of a Cochran\u2013Mantel\u2013Haenszel test stratified according to PD-L1 status and metastasis stage.\n\n\u00a7 The median was calculated with the use of the Kaplan\u2013Meier method. Data were censored for the range values because the observations are ongoing. The cutoff date for clinical data was August 5, 2014, with a range of follow-up from 5.2 to 16.7 months.\n\nmutation. In this group of patients, only ipilimumab in combination with dacarbazine has been associated with a survival benefit, as compared with dacarbazine alone, in a phase 3, controlled trial.5 When the present study was planned in 2012, ipilimumab had not been approved for use as a first-line treatment for advanced melanoma in most regions outside the United States. However, during the course of this study, it was approved for first-line therapy in most regions. Nevertheless, dacarbazine is still used as a firstline therapy for metastatic melanoma in many countries.\n\nAn additional phase 3 study (CheckMate 067; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01844505), evaluating both nivolumab monotherapy and combination therapy with nivolumab plus ipilimumab, as compared with ipilimumab alone, in previously untreated patients with melanoma is currently under way. The activity of ipilimumab is probably reflected in the performance of the dacarbazine group in the present study. The median survival in the dacarbazine group (10.8 months) in this study is higher than that previously reported,5 possibly because 38% of the dacarbazine-treated patients received ipilimumab after stopping the study treatment.\n\nThe objective response rate (40%) and duration of response associated with nivolumab that were observed in this study are in line with\n\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.

These results are in agreement with the long-term follow-up data from a phase 1 study of nivolumab, which showed a median duration of response of almost 2 years and an objective response rate of 32% among patients with advanced melanoma.<sup>22</sup>\n\nThe response rate with a BRAF or MEK inhibitor was recently surpassed by new combination regimens in patients with a *BRAF* V600 mutation11,12; however, for patients who have melanoma without a *BRAF* mutation, treatment options beyond ipilimumab are limited. Although the target population of our study was restricted to patients with melanoma who did not have a *BRAF* mutation, previous studies have shown that nivolumab had similar clinical activity regardless of the patient's *BRAF* mutation status.17,24\n\nPrevious studies, which have used various methodologic approaches, have shown a correlation between PD-L1 expression and objective response in patients with metastatic melanoma treated with anti\u2013PD-1 or anti\u2013PD-L1 antibodies.21,22,24-28 In our study, given the magnitude of the clinical benefit observed in patients receiving nivolumab versus those receiving dacarbazine, PD-L1 status alone, as assessed with the use of the methods presented here, does not\n\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\n\nDownloaded from nejm.org at Chalmers Tekniska Hogskola on June 16, 2025.

Also, because there was little difference in median overall survival between the two subgroups of dacarbazine-treated patients defined according to PD-L1 status (positive vs. negative or indeterminate), the prognostic role of PD-L1 status remains to be determined.\n\nThe safety profile of nivolumab in this study was similar to that observed previously.15-17,22 The frequency of selected adverse events with a potential immunologic cause was similar to the frequency observed in a previous phase 3 trial,17 and the events resolved in the majority of our patients.\n\nIn conclusion, nivolumab was associated with a significant improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival, as compared with dacarbazine.

We investigated encorafenib, a BRAF inhibitor with unique target-binding properties, alone or in combination with the MEK inhibitor binimetinib, versus vemurafenib in patients with advanced** *BRAF***V600-mutant melanoma.**\n\n**Methods COLUMBUS was conducted as a two-part, randomised, open-label phase 3 study at 162 hospitals in 28 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had histologically confirmed locally advanced (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV), unresectable or metastatic cutaneous melanoma, or unknown primary melanoma; a** *BRAF***V600E or** *BRAF***V600K mutation; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1; and were treatment naive or had progressed on or after previous firstline immunotherapy. In part 1 of the study, patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) via interactive response technology to receive either oral encorafenib 450 mg once daily plus oral binimetinib 45 mg twice daily (encorafenib plus binimetinib group), oral encorafenib 300 mg once daily (encorafenib group), or oral vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily (vemurafenib group). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival by blinded independent central review for encorafenib plus binimetinib versus vemurafenib. Efficacy analyses were by intention-to-treat. Safety was analysed in patients who received at least one dose of study drug and one postbaseline safety assessment. The results of part 2 will be published separately. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01909453, and EudraCT, number 2013-001176-38.**\n\n**Findings Between Dec 30, 2013, and April 10, 2015, 577 of 1345 screened patients were randomly assigned to either the encorafenib plus binimetinib group (n=192), the encorafenib group (n=194), or the vemurafenib group (n=191). With a median follow-up of 16\u00b76 months (95% CI 14\u00b78\u201316\u00b79), median progression-free survival was 14\u00b79 months (95% CI 11\u00b70\u201318\u00b75) in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group and 7\u00b73 months (5\u00b76\u20138\u00b72) in the vemurafenib group (hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b754, 95% CI 0\u00b741\u20130\u00b771; two-sided p<0\u00b70001). The most common grade 3\u20134 adverse events seen in more than 5% of patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group were increased \u03b3-glutamyltransferase (18 [9%] of 192 patients), increased creatine phosphokinase (13 [7%]), and hypertension (11 [6%]); in the encorafenib group they were palmoplantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (26 [14%] of 192 patients), myalgia (19 [10%]), and arthralgia (18 [9%]); and in the vemurafenib group it was arthralgia (11 [6%] of 186 patients). There were no treatmentrelated deaths except for one death in the combination group, which was considered possibly related to treatment by the investigator.** \n\n**Interpretation Encorafenib plus binimetinib and encorafenib monotherapy showed favourable efficacy compared with vemurafenib. Overall, encorafenib plus binimetinib appears to have an improved tolerability profile compared with encorafenib or vemurafenib. Encorafenib plus binimetinib could represent a new treatment option for patients with** *BRAF***-mutant melanoma.**\n\n**Funding Array BioPharma, Novartis.**\n\n**Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The most frequent is the *BRAF*V600 mutation, which occurs in 35\u201350% of patients with a melanoma.1 Activating *BRAF* mutations drive constitutive MAPK pathway activation, with subsequent proliferation and enhanced cellular survival, making BRAF kinase a promising therapeutic\n\n#### *Lancet Oncol* **2018; 19: 603\u201315**\n\nPublished **Online** March 21, 2018 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/ S1470-2045(18)30142-6 See **Comment** page 580\n\n\\*Contributed equally as first authors\n\n\u2020Contributed equally as final authors\n\n**Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Z\u00fcrich Skin Cancer Center, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland**  (Prof R Drummer MD)**; Melanoma Unit, Cancer Immunotherapy and Innovative Therapies,Istituto Nazionale Tumori IRCCS Fondazione Pascale, Naples, Italy** (P A Ascierto MD)**; Department of Internal Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Laikon Hospital, Athens, Greece** (H J Gogas MD)**; Department of Medical Oncology, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain**  (A Arance MD)**; Department of Oncology and Haematology, Papa Giovanni XXIII Cancer Center Hospital, Bergamo, Italy** (M Mandala MD)**; Department of Dermatology, National Institute of Oncology, Budapest, Hungary** (Prof G Liszkay MD)**; Department of Dermatology, University Hospital T\u00fcebingen, T\u00fcebingen, Germany**  (Prof C Garbe MD)**; Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany**  (Prof D Schadendorf MD)**; German Cancer Consortium, Heidelberg, Germany**  (Prof D Schadendorf)**; Department of Dermato-oncology, University Hospital Prague, Charles University First Medical Faculty, Prague, Czech Republic** \n\n![](_page_0_Picture_20.jpeg)\n\n(I Krajsova MD)**; Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Skin Cancer Center Hannover, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany**  (Prof R Gutzmer MD)**; Melanoma Cancer Unit, Oncology Institute of Veneto IRCCS, Padua, Italy**  (V Chiarion-Sileni MD)**; Department of Oncologic Dermatology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Bordeaux, H\u00f4pital Saint-Andr\u00e9, Bordeaux, France**  (C Dutriaux MD)**; Department of Medical Oncology, Isala, Zwolle, Netherlands**  (J W B de Groot MD)**; Department of Dermatologic Oncology, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan** (N Yamazaki MD)**; Department of Dermatology, University Medical Center Mainz, Mainz, Germany** (C Loquai MD)**; Translational Clinical Oncology, Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland**  (L A Moutouh-de Parseval MD)**; Array BioPharma, Boulder, CO, USA** (M D Pickard PhD, V Sandor MD)**; Service of Dermatology,Department of Medicine, Paris-Sud University, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France** (Prof C Robert MD)**; and** \n\n**Cancer Center,Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA** (K T Flaherty MD) Correspondence to: Prof Reinhard Dummer, Department of Dermatology, Skin Cancer Center, University\n\nHospital Z\u00dcrich, 8091 Z\u00dcrich, Switzerland **reinhard.dummer@usz.ch**\n\n## **Research in context**\n\n#### **Evidence before this study**\n\nWe searched for articles and abstracts during the development of this Article that were published in PubMed and Embase between Jan 1, 2014, and Dec 20, 2017. Search terms were comprehensive (\"melanoma\"+\"treatment\"+\"phase\" [all fields]; \"encorafenib\", \"BRAF inhibition\"+\"melanoma\" [all fields]). Selected abstracts were not limited to those in the English language and focused on phase 3 clinical trial data. Our search results indicated that a combination of available BRAF and MEK-pathway inhibitors provided additional benefit with reasonable tolerability in advanced melanoma compared with BRAF-inhibitor monotherapy. Preclinical and phase 1 and 2 clinical data suggested that the BRAF inhibitor encorafenib in combination with the MEK inhibitor binimetinib could further improve therapy for patients with *BRAF*-mutant melanoma.\n\n#### **Added value of this study**\n\nIn this randomised trial in patients with *BRAF*-mutant melanoma, treatment with the combination of the BRAF inhibitor encorafenib 450 mg and the MEK inhibitor binimetinib 45 mg improved progression-free survival and overall response compared with encorafenib 300 mg or vemurafenib, with better\n\ntolerability. Furthermore, in what to our knowledge is the first controlled head-to-head comparison of BRAF-inhibitor monotherapy, encorafenib showed a progression-free survival advantage compared with vemurafenib. Additionally, the combination of encorafenib with binimetinib ameliorated toxic effects associated with encorafenib monotherapy, enabling the use of a higher dose of encorafenib. Consistent with preclinical findings, our results show that encorafenib monotherapy provides improved clinical efficacy compared with vemurafenib monotherapy, and that high-intensity, extended BRAF inhibition, in combination with MEK inhibition, could result in improved tumour control.\n\n#### **Implications of all the available evidence**\n\nEncorafenib in combination with binimetinib is a well tolerated and efficacious treatment option for *BRAF*-mutant metastatic melanoma. Overall survival data and long-term safety data will provide additional insights into the efficacy and tolerability of this combination. Additionally, our findings indicate that the combination of encorafenib with binimetinib has a different toxicity profile from other combinations of BRAF-MEK inhibitors, with low frequencies of pyrexia and photosensitivity.\n\ntarget.1 In-vitro investigations have shown that growth of *BRAF*-mutated melanoma cells can be inhibited by BRAF or MEK inhibitors.2\n\nA crystallography-guided drug design approach produced several candidate ATP-competitive BRAFkinase inhibitors that were investigated in clinical trials. Vemurafenib was the first to show efficacy in *BRAF*mutant melanoma,3,4 followed by dabrafenib.5 MAPK pathway reactivation is implicated in BRAF-inhibitor monotherapy resistance.6 Additionally, toxic effects associated with BRAF inhibition, notably secondary squamous-cell skin cancer and other skin toxicities, are caused by BRAF inhibitors paradoxically activating the wild-type BRAF kinase, promoting dimerisation that triggers RAS-independent transactivation, and activation of the MAPK pathway in normal tissues.7 Subsequent clinical trials8\u201311 in patients with *BRAF*V600-mutant melanoma have shown that dual MAPK-pathway targeting with a BRAF inhibitor and a MEK inhibitor improves efficacy and ameliorates paradoxical MAPK activation-related toxic effects associated with BRAFinhibitor monotherapy. Two BRAF-MEK inhibitor combinations (dabrafenib-trametinib and vemurafenibcobimetinib) are regarded as treatment options for metastatic or unresectable *BRAF*V600-mutant melanoma in current guidelines.12,13 These BRAF-MEK inhibitor combinations are highly effective. However, both are associated with disease progression at approximately 12 months, and each combination causes different toxic effects in patients, highlighting the need for more effective and better tolerated therapies.8\u201310,14\u201317\n\nEncorafenib is an ATP-competitive BRAF inhibitor that suppresses the MAPK pathway in tumour cells that express several mutated forms of BRAF kinase (eg, V600E, V600D, and V600K mutations), with a more than 10-times longer dissociation half-life (>30 h) than either dabrafenib or vemurafenib, which enables sustained target inhibition.18 Preclinical studies suggest that this property could enhance antitumour activity while reducing paradoxical activation of MAPK pathways in normal tissues.18,19 Binimetinib is an orally available, non-ATPcompetitive, allosteric inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2.20\n\nPromising clinical activity and tolerability of the combination of encorafenib and binimetinib has been seen in patients with *BRAF*V600-mutated melanoma in a phase 1b/2 and a phase 2 study. 21,22 Furthermore, the maximum tolerated dose of encorafenib when combined with binimetinib was higher than the maximum tolerated dose of encorafenib monotherapy, thus allowing the use of a higher encorafenib dose when combined with binimetinib in subsequent trials.22 Here, we describe the results of part one of the COLUMBUS trial, a phase 3 study of encorafenib plus binimetinib versus vemurafenib or encorafenib monotherapy in patients with advanced *BRAF*V600-mutant unresectable melanoma.\n\n# **Methods**\n\n## **Study design and participants**\n\nCOLUMBUS is a two-part, multicentre, randomised, open-label phase 3 study of the efficacy and safety of encorafenib plus binimetinib combination therapy versus vemurafenib or encorafenib monotherapy in patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic *BRAF*V600-mutant melanoma. The study was originally designed to compare the efficacy of encorafenib 450 mg once daily plus binimetinib 45 mg twice daily with vemurafenib given at its clinically indicated dose, and with encorafenib given at 300 mg once daily (its maximum well tolerated dose as a monotherapy). However, because of a request from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the study protocol was amended on Nov 4, 2014, and a new study phase (part two) was added to better understand and isolate the contribution of binimetinib to the combination by comparing encorafenib 300 mg plus binimetinib 45 mg against encorafenib 300 mg alone.\n\nIn part one of the study, patients were recruited at 162 hospitals in 28 countries, including 20 sites in North America, 124 sites in Europe, and 18 sites in other selected countries (appendix p 2\u20135). After completion of enrolment in part one, patients were recruited into part two of the study following the same eligibility criteria, and the combination of encorafenib at its monotherapy maximum tolerated dose plus binimetinib was compared with encorafenib monotherapy at the same dose. Part 2 was done to better characterise the contribution of binimetinib to the combination therapy, and the results will be published separately.\n\nTo be eligible, patients needed to be aged 18 years or older and meet the following criteria: have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV), unresectable or metastatic cutaneous melanoma, or unknown primary melanoma (as per amendment 3; Nov 4, 2014); have the presence of a *BRAF*V600E or *BRAF*V600K mutation, or both, in their tumour tissue; have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1; have adequate bone marrow, organ function (including cardiac function), and laboratory parameters (ie, absolute neutrophil count, haemoglobin concentration, platelet count, aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase concentrations, and total bilirubin, creatinine, or calculated creatinine clearance); have evidence of at least one measurable lesion as detected by radiological or photographic methods according to guidelines based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1;23 and be treatment naive or have progressed on or after previous first-line immunotherapy (acceptable test limits for laboratory parameters are in the appendix, p 6). Key exclusion criteria included untreated CNS lesions; uveal or mucosal melanoma; known positive serology for human immunodeficiency virus, or an active hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection, or both; history of leptomeningeal metastases; a history of, current evidence of, or risk of retinal vein occlusion; Gilbert's syndrome; previous treatment with a BRAF or MEK inhibitor; previous systemic chemotherapy (as per protocol amendment 2 on Dec 22, 2013, and clarified in amendment 3 on Nov 4, 2014), extensive radiotherapy, or use of an investigational agent other than previous immunotherapy for locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic melanoma (immunotherapy must have ended at least 6 weeks before randomisation); impaired cardiovascular function; uncontrolled arterial hypertension; and neuromuscular disorders associated with high concentrations of creatine kinase. The full list of exclusion criteria is in the study protocol (appendix p 93).\n\nIndependent ethics committees or review boards at each study site approved the study protocol and amendments 1\u20134. Conduct of the study conformed with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the ethical requirements outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients before screening procedures were initiated.\n\nSee **Online** for appendix\n\n## **Randomisation and masking**\n\nPatients were randomly allocated into one of the three treatment groups in the trial (1:1:1) to receive either encorafenib plus binimetinib (encorafenib plus binimetinib group), encorafenib (encorafenib group), or vemurafenib (vemurafenib group) by use of validated interactive response technology (Parexel International, Billerica, MA, USA). Randomisation was stratified by AJCC stage (IIIB, IIIC, IVM1a, IVM1b, or IVM1c), ECOG performance status (0 or 1), and *BRAF*-mutation status (*BRAF*V600E *vs BRAF*V600K). After protocol amendment 2 (Dec 20, 2013), previous first-line immunotherapy (yes *vs* no) replaced *BRAF*-mutation status as a stratification factor. Investigators and patients were not masked to treatment assignment.\n\n## **Procedures**\n\nCentral genetic mutation analysis to ascertain the presence of *BRAF* mutations was done for all patients before enrolment with the bioM\u00e9rieux THxID BRAF diagnostic test (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France), which identifies both *BRAF*V600E and *BRAF*V600K gene mutations. Instances of previous immunotherapy were recorded for all patients. Patients received either encorafenib 450 mg orally once daily plus binimetinib 45 mg orally twice daily, encorafenib 300 mg orally once daily, or vemurafenib 960 mg orally twice daily according to randomised treatment assignment, and continued treatment until progression of disease per central review, death, unacceptable toxic effects, or withdrawal of consent. The type and frequency of clinical laboratory assessments are described in the appendix (p 10). Dose modifications, including treatment interruptions and dose reductions, were permitted for each of the drugs on the basis of tolerability and adverse events. Details regarding drug manufacture and permitted dose modifications are in the appendix (p 6).\n\nThe relative dose intensity was defined as 100 \u00d7 (the total cumulative dose a patient actually received while a on the study) divided by (the total cumulative dose a patient was scheduled to receive [ie, had they not had any dose adjustments or interruptions] while on the study).\n\nBaseline imaging was done within 21 days of randomisation and included chest, abdomen, and pelvis MRI or CT, and brain MRI or CT to assess CNS disease. In the case of suspected bone metastases, a whole-body bone scan was done. Localised CT, MRI, or radiography was done for all skeletal lesions identified via the bone scan if not visible on the chest, abdomen, and pelvis CT or MRI. If clinically indicated, a CT or MRI scan was done of other areas of disease, as appropriate. Colour photographs were taken of all skin lesions, and lesion sizes were estimated with a metric ruler. Tumours were evaluated every 8 weeks during the first 24 months, and every 12 weeks thereafter, by use of the same imaging method as at baseline. Additional tumour assessments were done if progression was suspected by the treating physician. Tumour response was assessed centrally by blinded independent committee review and by local review according to guidelines based on RECIST version 1.1.\n\nFor safety assessments, we collected data on all adverse events; physical examinations such as specific ophthalmic and dermatological examinations, cardiac assessments (electrocardiogram and multiple-gated acquisition scan or echocardiogram); and clinical laboratory assessments. Because of the ocular-related toxicity profile of MEK inhibitors, all patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group had routine ophthalmic testing at each regularly scheduled visit during the treatment period**.** For patients in the encorafenib and vemurafenib groups, ophthalmic testing at each regularly scheduled visit was only required if retinal abnormalities were present at baseline. Details on the ophthalmological examinations are included in the appendix (p 6). The severity of adverse events was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03.24 We monitored adverse events during the study and for at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug.\n\nThe data cutoff date for analyses presented here was May 19, 2016. No interim analysis was done before the primary progression-free survival analysis presented in this Article. A data monitoring committee reviewed safety data approximately every 6 months.\n\n## **Outcomes**\n\nThe primary endpoint was the comparison of progressionfree survival in the encorafenib plus binimetinib versus vemurafenib groups as assessed by blinded independent central review. Progression-free survival was defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the date of the first documented disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. If a patient did not have a progression event at the time of the analysis cutoff or at the start of any new antineoplastic therapy, their data were censored at the date of last adequate tumour assessment. The key secondary endpoint was comparison of progression-free survival in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group versus the encorafenib group. Other secondary endpoints included comparison of the progression-free survival of patients in the encorafenib group versus the vemurafenib group; best overall response (complete response, partial response, stable disease, progressive disease, or unknown, derived per RECIST version 1.1), overall response (proportion of patients with a best overall response of confirmed complete response or partial response), disease control (the proportion of patients with a best overall response of confirmed complete response, partial response, or stable disease [including patients with non-measurable disease]), duration of response (time from the date of first documented response [confirmed complete response or partial response] to the first documented progression or death due to melanoma), time to response (time between date of randomisation until first documented response of complete response or partial response), and safety of encorafenib plus binimetinib and encorafenib. Data from tumour assessments read by blinded independent central review were used for the primary and secondary endpoints and analysis of best overall response, duration of response, and disease control; data from local review were used in supportive analyses. Analyses of other secondary outcomes to be reported in a separate manuscript include overall survival, quality of life, resource utilisation, comparison of ECOG performance status, and pharmacokinetic analysis.\n\n## **Statistical analysis**\n\nSample size calculations were based on assumptions for progression-free survival medians derived from results of a phase 1b/2 study (NCT01543698)22 for encorafenib plus binimetinib, a phase 1 study for encorafenib,18 and updated results from the BRIM-325 and BRIM-226/ COMBI-v,9 and coBRIM14,27 trials for vemurafenib.\n\nAnalyses of the primary and key (type-I error controlled) secondary endpoints for part one of the study were event driven and done when patient enrolment in part one was complete and the prespecified number of progressionfree survival events for both the final primary and part one key secondary comparison were available. We used a hierarchical testing procedure to control type-I errors for the primary and key secondary endpoints. The key secondary endpoint of part one (progression-free survival of encorafenib plus binimetinib *vs* encorafenib) was to be tested if the primary efficacy endpoint (progression-free survival of encorafenib plus binimetinib *vs* vemurafenib) was significant. The driver of sample size was the key secondary endpoint of progression-free survival with encorafenib plus binimetinib versus encorafenib (as per amendment 3; appendix p 47); for this comparison, 191 progression-free survival events were required to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0\u00b7667 with 80% power by use of a log-rank test at a one-sided 2\u00b75% level of significance. For the primary comparisons of encorafenib plus binimetinib versus vemurafenib, 145 progressionfree survival events were required to detect an HR of 0\u00b758 with 90% power by use of a log-rank test at a one-sided 2\u00b75% level of significance. Assuming that 15% of patients would be lost to follow-up, we estimated that 576 patients (192 in each group) would need to be recruited.\n\nWe analysed efficacy endpoints in the intention-to-treat population, which comprised all patients who had been randomised. Patients were analysed by treatment group and strata, as assigned during randomisation. Safety was analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one postbaseline safety assessment; patients were analysed according to the treatment they actually received. All data were used to the greatest extent possible without imputations for missing data (appendix p 7).\n\nMedian duration of follow-up for progression-free survival was estimated first, by summarising the observed follow-up for each patient (ie, the duration from date of randomisation to date of progression-free survival event or censoring), and second, through reverse Kaplan-Meier analyses. The reverse Kaplan-Meier median values are reported and reflect the potential follow-up in the absence of progressive disease or death. Progression-free survival was analysed according to the treatment group and two of the stratification factors (AJCC stage and ECOG performance status). Owing to the low expected prevalence of patients with previous immunotherapy (about 15%), for the stratified analyses it was prespecified that the two previous immunotherapy strata (yes *vs*

Comparison of the distribution of progression-free survival used a stratified log-rank test (for the purposes of this summary, two-sided p values are reported). We presented the distribution of progression-free survival using the Kaplan-Meier method. We used stratified Cox regression models to estimate the HRs for progression-free survival, along with 95% CIs based on the Wald test. Sensitivity analyses were also prespecified. Prespecified sensitivity analyses examined different censoring rules, unstratified analyses, analyses of progression-free survival based on local tumour assessments, and analyses of the per-protocol population (appendix p 7). Subgroup analyses of baseline variables and potential prognostic factors, including previous immunotherapy, were also prespecified. We confirmed the proportional hazards assumption of the Cox models graphically with plots of log(\u2212log[estimated survivor function]) versus log(time). We used the same methods for the key secondary comparison. We presented the overall response and disease control by treatment group with exact 95% CIs. Duration of response and time to response were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology. As part of the secondary outcome of encorafenib plus binimetinib and encorafenib safety, we summarised the time to first event using Kaplan-Meier methodology for several prespecified safety parameters. Median time to onset and 95% CIs were summarised, and we described other median values with 95% CIs or IQRs. We included nominal p values for secondary endpoints for descriptive purposes.\n\nSAS (version 9.2 or higher) was used for all analyses. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01909453, and with EudraCT, number 2013-001176-38.\n\n# **Role of the funding source**\n\nThe study was sponsored and designed with input from the steering committee (RD, PAA, CR, and KTF) by Novartis until September, 2015, when sponsorship was transferred to Array BioPharma. Data were collected by Novartis and Array BioPharma during their respective sponsorships. Data were analysed by Array BioPharma's statistical team and interpreted by the study authors in collaboration with Array BioPharma. RD, PAA, CR, and KTF wrote the first draft of the report. Editorial support was funded by the study sponsor. RD, PAA, CR, and KTF had full access to all the data in the study, and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\n\n# **Results**\n\nBetween Dec 30, 2013, and April 10, 2015, 1345 patients were assessed, of whom 577 were enrolled and randomly assigned to a treatment group (192 to the encorafenib plus binimetinib group, 194 to the encorafenib group, and 191 to the vemurafenib group; figure 1). As of the data cutoff on May 19, 2016, treatment was ongoing in 68 (35%) of 192 patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group, 46 (24%) of 194 patients in the encorafenib group, and 27 (14%) of 191 patients in the vemurafenib group. Demographic and clinical characteristics, including key prognostic factors at baseline, were similar across treatment groups (table 1). Patients had extensive disease, with 368 (64%) of 577 patients overall having stage IVM1c disease and 260 (45%) having three or more organs involved. 172 (30%) patients overall had previously had immunotherapy and 26 (5%) patients had previously had checkpoint inhibitor therapy.\n\nThe date for the data cutoff was event driven on the basis of achieving the required number of progression events for both the primary (encorafenib plus binimetinib *vs* vemurafenib) and key secondary (encorafenib plus binimetinib *vs* encorafenib) comparisons. At the time of data cutoff, 98 events for the encorafenib plus binimetinib group, 96 events for the encorafenib group, and 106 events for the vemurafenib group contributed to the analysis of progression-free survival. Median follow-up was 16\u00b77 months (95% CI 16\u00b73\u201318\u00b74) for the encorafenib plus binimetinib group, 16\u00b76 months (14\u00b78\u201318\u00b71) for the encorafenib group, and 14\u00b74 months (10\u00b71\u201316\u00b76) for the vemurafenib group; median follow-up for all patients was 16\u00b76 months (14\u00b78\u201316\u00b79). The duration of progression-free survival, by summary of the observed follow-up for each patient and by reverse Kaplan-Meier analysis, is in the appendix (p 11).\n\nMedian progression-free survival assessed by blinded independent central review was longer for patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group (14\u00b79 months, 95% CI 11\u00b70\u201318\u00b75) than for those in the encorafenib (9\u00b76 months, 7\u00b75\u201314\u00b78) or vemurafenib (7\u00b73 months, 5\u00b76\u20138\u00b72) groups. Results of the per-protocol analyses were consistent (appendix p 12). Median progression-free survival by local review was similar: 14\u00b78 months (95% CI 10\u00b74\u201318\u00b74) for the encorafenib plus binimetinib group, 9\u00b72 months (7\u00b74\u201312\u00b79) for the encorafenib group, and 7\u00b73 months (5\u00b77\u20138\u00b75) for the vemurafenib group (appendix p 23).\n\nThe primary comparison of progression-free survival by blinded independent central review of the encorafenib plus binimetinib versus vemurafenib groups showed a significant reduction in the risk of progression or death (HR 0\u00b754, 95% CI 0\u00b741\u20130\u00b771; two-sided p<0\u00b70001; figure 2A). Progression-free survival by local review was similarly improved with encorafenib plus binimetinib versus vemurafenib (0\u00b749, 0\u00b737\u20130\u00b764; two-sided nominal p<0\u00b70001; appendix p 23). All subgroup analyses for the comparison of encorafenib plus binimetinib with vemurafenib showed point estimates in favour of the encorafenib plus binimetinib group, except for the presence of brain metastases at baseline, but this analysis included only nine patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group and three patients in the vemurafenib group (figure 3).\n\nThe key secondary comparison of progression-free survival by blinded independent central review showed a median of 14\u00b79 (95% CI 11\u00b70\u201318\u00b75) months in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group and 9\u00b76 (7\u00b75\u201314\u00b78) months in the encorafenib group (HR 0\u00b775, 95% CI 0\u00b756\u2013 1\u00b700; two-sided p=0\u00b7051; figure 2B). Progression-free survival by local assessment showed a larger treatment effect for the encorafenib plus binimetinib group than for the encorafenib group (0\u00b768, 95% CI 0\u00b752\u20130\u00b790; two-sided nominal p=0\u00b70064; appendix p 23). In other secondary endpoints, comparison of progression-free survival by blinded independent central review favoured the encorafenib group over the vemurafenib group (0\u00b768, 95% CI 0\u00b752\u20130\u00b790; two-sided nominal p=0\u00b70070); similar results were obtained by local assessment (appendix p 24).\n\nA confirmed overall response by blinded independent central review occurred in 121 (63%) of 192 patients in the\n\n![](_page_6_Figure_6.jpeg)\n\n*Figure 2:* **Kaplan-Meier curves of progression-free survival for encorafenib 450 mg plus binimetinib 45 mg versus vemurafenib 960 mg (A) and encorafenib 450 mg plus binimetinib 45 mg versus encorafenib 300 mg (B)**\n\nResponse was assessed by blinded independent central review.

The confirmed overall response by local review had a similar pattern but was higher in each group than in the central review (table 2). The median time to response by blinded independent central review in responding patients corresponded to the time of the first assessment and was 1\u00b78 months (95% CI 1\u00b78\u20131\u00b79) for the encorafenib plus binimetinib group, 1\u00b79 months (1\u00b79\u20131\u00b79) for the encorafenib group, and 1\u00b79 months (1\u00b78\u20131\u00b79) for the vemurafenib group. Median duration of confirmed objective response by blinded independent central review was 16\u00b76 months (12\u00b72\u201320\u00b74) for the encorafenib plus binimetinib group, 14\u00b79 months (11\u00b71\u2013not estimable) for the encorafenib group, and 12\u00b73 months (6\u00b79\u201316\u00b79) for the vemurafenib group.\n\nIn the encorafenib plus binimetinib group, the median duration of

Median duration of treatment was 31\u00b74 weeks (16\u00b76\u201369\u00b71) in the encorafenib group and 27\u00b71 weeks (15\u00b71\u201348\u00b73) in the vemurafenib group. The median dose intensities in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group were\n\n100% (IQR 93\u2013100) of planned doses for encorafenib and 99\u00b76% (80\u2013100) of planned doses for binimetinib. Median dose intensity was 86% (55\u2013100) of the planned dose for encorafenib and 94% (74\u2013100) for vemurafenib. The distribution of dose intensity for each treatment group is shown in the appendix (p 25). Most of the 192 patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group were able to achieve a dose intensity of 80\u2013100% (152 [79%] for encorafenib and 144 [75%] for binimetinib), and few patients receiving the combination were given less than 50% dose intensity (five [3%] for encorafenib and 11 [6%] for binimetinib). By contrast, 98 (51%) of 192 patients in the encorafenib group and 116 (62%) of 186 patients in the vemurafenib group achieved a dose intensity of 80\u2013100%, and 42 (22%) in the encorafenib group and 13 (7%) in the vemurafenib group achieved a dose intensity of less than 50% (appendix p 25).\n\n192 patients were assessable for safety in both the encorafenib plus binimetinib and encorafenib groups, and 186 patients in the vemurafenib group. Grade 1 or 2 adverse events occurring in at least 10% of patients and grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurring in at least 2% of patients in any treatment group are summarised in table 3 (the appendix [p 13] lists all grade 3\u20134 adverse events in the treatment groups; as per the study protocol, deaths were not graded and therefore were not included in table 3). Common adverse events reported more frequently in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group than in the encorafenib or vemurafenib groups (with a difference in proportion of patients of 10% or higher) were gastrointestinal toxic effects (diarrhoea, constipation, vomiting, and abdominal pain), predominantly asymptomatic increases in creatine phosphokinase, and blurred vision. Common adverse events reported at a lower frequency (with a difference in proportion of patients of 10% or higher) in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group than in the encorafenib or vemurafenib groups were toxic effects to the skin (eg, pruritus, hyperkeratosis, rash, keratosis pilaris, palmoplantar keratoderma, palmoplantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome, dry skin, skin papilloma, macropapular rash, and sunburn), alopecia, photosensitivity reaction, arthralgia, myalgia, pain in the extremities, decreased appetite, musculoskeletal pain, and decreased weight.\n\nGrade 3\u20134 adverse events were reported in fewer patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group (111 [58%] of 192) than in either the encorafenib (127 [66%] of 192) or vemurafenib (118 [63%] of 186) groups. The most common grade 3\u20134 adverse events seen in more than 5% of patients were increased \u03b3-glutamyltransferase (18 [9%] of 192 patients), increased creatine phosphokinase (13 [7%]), and hypertension (11 [6%]) in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group; palmoplantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (26 [14%] of 192 patients), myalgia (19 [10%]), and arthralgia (18 [9%]) in the encorafenib group; and arthralgia (11 [6%] of 186 patients) in the vemurafenib group. The median time to first grade 3 or 4 toxic effect in all patients who could be evaluated for safety was longer\n\n|                       | Encorafenib 450 mg plus<br>binimetinib 45 mg group (n=192) |                  | Encorafenib 300 mg group (n=194) |                  | Vemurafenib 960 mg group (n=191) |                  |  |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|------------------|--|\n|                       | Central review                                             | Local review     | Central review                   | Local review     | Central review                   | Local review     |  |\n| Best overall response |                                                            |                  |                                  |                  |                                  |                  |  |\n| Complete response     | 15 (8%)                                                    | 31 (16%)         | 10 (5%)                          | 17 (9%)          | 11 (6%)                          | 14 (7%)          |  |\n| Partial response      | 106 (55%)                                                  | 113 (59%)        | 88 (45%)                         | 95 (49%)         | 66 (35%)                         | 80 (42%)         |  |\n| Stable disease*       | 56 (29%)                                                   | 35 (18%)         | 65 (34%)                         | 56 (29%)         | 79 (41%)                         | 66 (35%)         |  |\n| Progressive disease\u2020  | 15 (8%)                                                    | 13 (7%)          | 31 (16%)                         | 26 (13%)         | 35 (18%)                         | 31 (16%)         |  |\n| Overall response\u2021     | 121 (63%; 56\u201370)                                           | 144 (75%; 68\u201381) | 98 (51%; 43\u201358)                  | 112 (58%; 50\u201365) | 77 (40%; 33\u201348)                  | 94 (49%; 42\u201357)  |  |\n| Disease control\u00a7      | 177 (92%; 87\u201396)                                           | 179 (93%; 89\u201396) | 163 (84%; 78\u201389)                 | 168 (87%; 81\u201391) | 156 (82%; 75\u201387)                 | 160 (84%; 78\u201389) |  |\n\nData are n (%) or n (%; 95% CI) in the efficacy population. \\*Includes patients with non-measurable disease and a status of non-complete response or non-progressive disease. \u2020Includes patients with best response of unknown or no assessment. \u2021Overall response was defined as complete response plus partial response. \u00a7Disease control defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response of complete response, partial response, stable disease, or non-complete response or non-progressive disease.\n\n*Table 2:* **Best overall confirmed response by treatment group**\n\nwithin the encorafenib plus binimetinib group than within the encorafenib or vemurafenib groups (appendix p 26). Similarly, fewer adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation occurred in patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group than in patients in the encorafenib or vemurafenib groups (appendix p 20). Time to discontinuation of treatment due to an adverse event was longer with encorafenib plus binimetinib than with encorafenib or vemurafenib (appendix p 26). Adverse events leading to discontinuation that were suspected to be related to study treatment occurred in 12 (6%) patients given encorafenib plus binimetinib, 19 (10%) given encorafenib, and 26 (14%) given vemurafenib (data not shown). The most frequent of these suspected treatmentrelated adverse events in each group were increased alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase (co-occurring in the same four [2%] patients) in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group, palmoplantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (five [3%] patients) in the encorafenib group, and increased \u03b3-glutamyltransferase, arthralgia, and photosensitivity reaction (each in three [2%] patients) in the vemurafenib group. Adverse events requiring dose reduction or interruption occurred in 92 (48%) patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group, 135 (70%) patients in the encorafenib group, and 114 (61%) patients in the vemurafenib group (appendix p 20).\n\nSerious adverse events occurred in 66 (34%) of 192 patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group, 65 (34%) of 192 patients in the encorafenib group, and 69 (37%) of 186 patients in the vemurafenib group. The most common serious adverse events by treatment group were pyrexia (in six [3%] patients) in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group, vomiting and nausea (each in six [3%] patients) in the encorafenib group, and deterioration of general physical health (in six [3%] patients) in the vemurafenib group.\n\nToxic effects associated with BRAF and MEK inhibitors were further explored by grouping individually reported adverse events for similar clinical entities or pathophysiological processes. These events included pyrexia, rash, photosensitivity, secondary non-melanoma skin cancers (including squamous-cell cancer and basalcell carcinoma), serous retinopathy (including retinal pigment epithelial detachment), left ventricular dysfunction, and abnormalities in liver function tests (appendix p 21). A toxic effect associated with the BRAF kinase inhibitor dabrafenib9,17\u2014pyrexia (including increased body temperature, hyperpyrexia, and hyperthermia)\u2014occurred in 35 (18%) of 192 patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group, 30 (16%) of 192 patients in the encorafenib group, and 55 (30%) of 186 patients in the vemurafenib group. Toxic effects to the skin, including rash, acneiform dermatitis, and palmoplantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome, occurred less frequently in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group than in the encorafenib or vemurafenib groups. Photosensitivity, a toxic effect associated with the BRAF-kinase inhibitor vemurafenib,10,14 was seen in 56 (30%) patients in the vemurafenib group, nine (5%) patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group, and eight (4%) patients in the encorafenib group. Secondary non-melanoma skin cancers occurred infrequently. The most common were squamouscell cancers, in five (3%) patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group, 15 (8%) in the encorafenib group, and 32 (17%) in the vemurafenib group (appendix p 21). Specific MEK inhibitor toxic effects, including serous retinopathy and left ventricular dysfunction, were seen more frequently in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group than either the encorafenib or vemurafenib groups. Serous retinopathy occurred in 38 (20%) patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group, four (2%) patients in the encorafenib group, and three (2%) patients in the vemurafenib group. Most of the events in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group were grade 1 (23 [12%] of 192 patients) or grade 2 (ten [5%]), and resulted in dose interruption or adjustment in 11 (6%) patients but did not result in treatment discontinuations. Left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 15 (8%) patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group, four (2%) patients in the\n\n|                                              | Encorafenib 450 mg

In the encorafenib plus binimetinib group, most left ventricular dysfunction was grade 1 (four [2%] of 192 patients) or grade 2 (eight [4%]; appendix p 21) led to dose interruption or adjustment in 12 (6%) patients, was generally reversible, and did not result in treatment discontinuations. Grade 3 adverse events of increased aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase concentrations were reported in 13 (7%) patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group, three (2%) patients in the encorafenib group, and three (2%) patients in the vemurafenib group (appendix p 21). No grade 3 or 4 bilirubin elevations occurred in any treatment group.\n\nDespite the longer duration of exposure in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group, the number of deaths that occurred during treatment or within 30 days of the last dose was similar among the three treatment groups: 17 (9%) of 192 patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group, 14 (7%) of 192 patients in the encorafenib group, and 19 (10%) of 186 patients in the vemurafenib group. On-treatment deaths were due to disease progression in 11 (6%) patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group, 12 (6%) patients in the encorafenib group, and 17 (9%) patients in the vemurafenib group. None of the deaths due to adverse events were considered likely to be related to study treatment (appendix p 22), although there was one death in the combination group, which was considered possibly related to treatment by the investigator. This patient stopped treatment on study day 9 and died by suicide on day 24, 15 days after the last dose of study drug.\n\n# **Discussion**\n\nIn this phase 3, randomised trial in patients with *BRAF*-mutant melanoma, encorafenib plus binimetinib showed a favourable efficacy and safety profile compared with vemurafenib monotherapy. Progression-free survival in patients treated with encorafenib plus binimetinib was significantly longer than in those treated with vemurafenib, and progression-free survival results were consistent with those seen in previous trials using vemurafenib in this setting.9,10 The encorafenib plus binimetinib group had a median progression-free survival of 14\u00b79 (95% CI 11\u00b70\u201318\u00b75) months while the encorafenib group had a median progression-free survival of 9\u00b76 (7\u00b75\u201314\u00b78) months; (HR 0\u00b775, 95% CI 0\u00b756\u20131\u00b700; twosided p=0\u00b7051; figure 2B). More patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group attained an overall response compared with those in the encorafenib group (121 [63%; 95% CI 56\u201370] *vs* 98 [51%; 43\u201358]) Additionally, the tolerability profile of encorafenib plus binimetinib appeared to be more favourable than vemurafenib or encorafenib monotherapy, as reflected in the higher dose intensity achieved and the longer median exposure to treatment in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group than the monotherapy groups. The adverse event profile was also favourable, with fewer grade 3 or 4 toxic effects, fewer toxic effects requiring dose interruption or modification, a later time to onset of grade 3 or 4 adverse events, and fewer treatment discontinuations due to adverse events in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group than in the monotherapy groups.\n\nThe mechanistic underpinnings of efficacy and safety for the various BRAF-MEK inhibitor combinations are probably based on the specific characteristics of the individual drugs. Encorafenib inhibits BRAFV600E kinase activity in a biochemical assay at similar concentrations as dabrafenib and vemurafenib. However, the dissociation half-life is longer than 30 h and much longer than those of dabrafenib (2 h) and vemurafenib (0\u00b75 h), resulting in improved pharmacodynamics with longer-lasting pERK inhibition.18 Furthermore, in *BRAF*V600-mutant cell lines, encorafenib was more potent at inhibiting proliferation than dabrafenib or vemurafenib.18\n\nPrevious studies suggest that the maximum monotherapy dose of encorafenib is 300 mg/day.18\n\nIn combination with the MEK inhibitor binimetinib, however, the toxicity and overall tolerability of encorafenib when given as a monotherapy are substantially ameliorated. This amelioration allows the use of the higher dose of encorafenib (450 mg) in the combination treatment, thus potentially providing greater pathway inhibition that lasts longer than the monotherapy.18 Consistent with these earlier results, this study confirmed the ability to safely increase the dose intensiy of encorafenib in the combination.\n\nIn the phase 3 COMBI-d and COMBI-v trials,8,9,28 median progression-free survival for dabrafenib-trametinib was 11\u00b70 months (95% CI 8\u00b70\u201313\u00b79) and 11\u00b74 months (9\u00b79\u201314\u00b79), respectively. Median progression-free survival for vemurafenib-cobimetinib in the phase 3 coBRIM study was 12\u00b73 months (9\u00b75\u201313\u00b74). 10 In this study, encorafenib plus binimetinib was associated with a median progression-free survival of 14\u00b79 months (11\u00b70\u201318\u00b75), the longest median progression-free survival seen to date with any BRAF-MEK inhibitor combination. Additionally, the improved efficacy of encorafenib compared with vemurafenib within this trial supports the hypothesis that extended pathway inhibition can lead to improved clinical outcomes. A direct comparison of encorafenib plus binimetinib with other BRAF-MEK inhibitor combinations would be needed to confirm improved clinical outcomes with encorafenib plus binimetinib.\n\nAlthough the available BRAF-MEK inhibitor combinations have largely overlapping toxicity profiles, each is associated with a specific toxic effect: pyrexia with dabrafenib-trametinib, and photosensitivity with vemurafenib-cobimetinib.29,30 Both of these toxic effects are infrequent with encorafenib plus binimetinib. Pyrexia is the most frequent adverse event with the dabrafenibtrametinib combination (in more than 50% of patients consistently in several studies9,11,17) and a leading cause of discontinuation, dose interruption, and dose reduction.9,17 Some patients have multiple episodes of pyrexia, with episodes lasting a median duration of 3 days and, in some cases, requiring prophylactic treatment with glucocorticoids.17 Photosensitivity reactions are common (seen in 47% of patients) with vemurafenib-cobimetinib.10,14,31 Photosensitivity is noted as requiring patient education and prospective and ongoing management by patients and clinical staff to mitigate effects.10 In this study, encorafenib plus binimetinib was associated with all-grade adverse events of interest including pyrexia in 35 (18%) patients and photosensitivity in nine (5%) patients. The features of pyrexia were qualitatively different from those observed with dabrafenib-trametinib, being generally of a lower grade, not recurrent, and most often associated with concurrent illness or progressive disease.\n\nThe proportion of patients who had MEK inhibitorrelated toxic effects, including serous retinopathy and left ventricular dysfunction, were largely in line with those observed in other BRAF-MEK inhibitor combination trials in which these effects were actively monitored. In this trial, the absolute frequency of serous retinopathy in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group was most likely affected by the frequency of monitoring; a high proportion of the events were asymptomatic and detected only through specialised eye examination. The protocolmandated intensity of monitoring for toxic effects to the eye known to be associated with MEK inhibitors in this trial was higher in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group than in the other two groups, which did not include an MEK inhibitor. Since this toxic effect is known to be related to MEK inhibitors, the difference in monitoring schedule probably did not substantially influence the observed difference in the frequency of serous retinopathy across the trial.\n\nThis study has several limitations. Few patients had received previous immunotherapy; the ongoing SECOMBIT (NCT02631447), EORTC 1612 (NCT03235245), and IMMU-TARGET (NCT02902042) studies are formally testing the optimal approach for sequencing immunotherapy with ipilimumab-nivolumab or pembrolizumab with encorafenib-binimetinib. These and other studies are anticipated to establish the optimal combinations and sequences of current treatment options that will further improve outcomes for patients with *BRAF*-mutant melanoma.\n\nAlthough cross-trial comparisons might be confounded by differences in patient populations, vemurafenib has been a common control across trials for all available BRAF-MEK inhibitor combinations, and its performance in those trials and in this study was similar. Median progressionfree survival was 7\u00b73 months (95% CI 5\u00b78\u20137\u00b78) in the COMBI-v study and 7\u00b72 months (5\u00b76\u20137\u00b75) in the coBRIM study,9,10,28 compared with 7\u00b73 months (5\u00b76\u20138\u00b72) by blinded independent central review and 7\u00b73 months (5\u00b77\u20138\u00b75) by local review in this study. These results suggest that despite differences in individual baseline prognostic factors (eg, the proportion of patients with increased lactate dehydrogenase concentrations), the populations in these trials are similar with respect to their expected response to treatment. The benefit of encorafenib plus binimetinib will be further defined with longer follow-ups for progression-free survival. Finally, overall survival data, when it becomes available, will provide additional insights into the efficacy of encorafenib plus binimetinib.\n\nIn conclusion, results of the COLUMBUS study show that encorafenib plus binimetinib improved progressionfree survival compared with vemurafenib and appears to have an improved tolerability profile compared with encorafenib or vemurafenib. Encorafenib plus binimetinib represents a new treatment option for patients with *BRAF*mutant melanoma, and further studies investigating the optimal sequence of available treatment modalities are underway.\n\n#### **Contributors**\n\nRD was on the steering committee, and contributed to protocol development, development of algorithms for adverse event management, trial management, analysis of the data, and writing.

We investigated encorafenib, a BRAF inhibitor with unique target-binding properties, alone or in combination with the MEK inhibitor binimetinib, versus vemurafenib in patients with advanced** *BRAF***V600-mutant melanoma.**\n\n**Methods COLUMBUS was conducted as a two-part, randomised, open-label phase 3 study at 162 hospitals in 28 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had histologically confirmed locally advanced (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV), unresectable or metastatic cutaneous melanoma, or unknown primary melanoma; a** *BRAF***V600E or** *BRAF***V600K mutation; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1; and were treatment naive or had progressed on or after previous firstline immunotherapy. In part 1 of the study, patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) via interactive response technology to receive either oral encorafenib 450 mg once daily plus oral binimetinib 45 mg twice daily (encorafenib plus binimetinib group), oral encorafenib 300 mg once daily (encorafenib group), or oral vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily (vemurafenib group). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival by blinded independent central review for encorafenib plus binimetinib versus vemurafenib. Efficacy analyses were by intention-to-treat. Safety was analysed in patients who received at least one dose of study drug and one postbaseline safety assessment. The results of part 2 will be published separately. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01909453, and EudraCT, number 2013-001176-38.**\n\n**Findings Between Dec 30, 2013, and April 10, 2015, 577 of 1345 screened patients were randomly assigned to either the encorafenib plus binimetinib group (n=192), the encorafenib group (n=194), or the vemurafenib group (n=191). With a median follow-up of 16\u00b76 months (95% CI 14\u00b78\u201316\u00b79), median progression-free survival was 14\u00b79 months (95% CI 11\u00b70\u201318\u00b75) in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group and 7\u00b73 months (5\u00b76\u20138\u00b72) in the vemurafenib group (hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b754, 95% CI 0\u00b741\u20130\u00b771; two-sided p<0\u00b70001). The most common grade 3\u20134 adverse events seen in more than 5% of patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group were increased \u03b3-glutamyltransferase (18 [9%] of 192 patients), increased creatine phosphokinase (13 [7%]), and hypertension (11 [6%]); in the encorafenib group they were palmoplantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (26 [14%] of 192 patients), myalgia (19 [10%]), and arthralgia (18 [9%]); and in the vemurafenib group it was arthralgia (11 [6%] of 186 patients). There were no treatmentrelated deaths except for one death in the combination group, which was considered possibly related to treatment by the investigator.** \n\n**Interpretation Encorafenib plus binimetinib and encorafenib monotherapy showed favourable efficacy compared with vemurafenib. Overall, encorafenib plus binimetinib appears to have an improved tolerability profile compared with encorafenib or vemurafenib.

Search terms were comprehensive (\"melanoma\"+\"treatment\"+\"phase\" [all fields]; \"encorafenib\", \"BRAF inhibition\"+\"melanoma\" [all fields]). Selected abstracts were not limited to those in the English language and focused on phase 3 clinical trial data. Our search results indicated that a combination of available BRAF and MEK-pathway inhibitors provided additional benefit with reasonable tolerability in advanced melanoma compared with BRAF-inhibitor monotherapy. Preclinical and phase 1 and 2 clinical data suggested that the BRAF inhibitor encorafenib in combination with the MEK inhibitor binimetinib could further improve therapy for patients with *BRAF*-mutant melanoma.\n\n#### **Added value of this study**\n\nIn this randomised trial in patients with *BRAF*-mutant melanoma, treatment with the combination of the BRAF inhibitor encorafenib 450 mg and the MEK inhibitor binimetinib 45 mg improved progression-free survival and overall response compared with encorafenib 300 mg or vemurafenib, with better\n\ntolerability. Furthermore, in what to our knowledge is the first controlled head-to-head comparison of BRAF-inhibitor monotherapy, encorafenib showed a progression-free survival advantage compared with vemurafenib. Additionally, the combination of encorafenib with binimetinib ameliorated toxic effects associated with encorafenib monotherapy, enabling the use of a higher dose of encorafenib. Consistent with preclinical findings, our results show that encorafenib monotherapy provides improved clinical efficacy compared with vemurafenib monotherapy, and that high-intensity, extended BRAF inhibition, in combination with MEK inhibition, could result in improved tumour control.\n\n#### **Implications of all the available evidence**\n\nEncorafenib in combination with binimetinib is a well tolerated and efficacious treatment option for *BRAF*-mutant metastatic melanoma. Overall survival data and long-term safety data will provide additional insights into the efficacy and tolerability of this combination. Additionally, our findings indicate that the combination of encorafenib with binimetinib has a different toxicity profile from other combinations of BRAF-MEK inhibitors, with low frequencies of pyrexia and photosensitivity.\n\ntarget.1 In-vitro investigations have shown that growth of *BRAF*-mutated melanoma cells can be inhibited by BRAF or MEK inhibitors.2\n\nA crystallography-guided drug design approach produced several candidate ATP-competitive BRAFkinase inhibitors that were investigated in clinical trials. Vemurafenib was the first to show efficacy in *BRAF*mutant melanoma,3,4 followed by dabrafenib.5 MAPK pathway reactivation is implicated in BRAF-inhibitor monotherapy resistance.6 Additionally, toxic effects associated with BRAF inhibition, notably secondary squamous-cell skin cancer and other skin toxicities, are caused by BRAF inhibitors paradoxically activating the wild-type BRAF kinase, promoting dimerisation that triggers RAS-independent transactivation, and activation of the MAPK pathway in normal tissues.7 Subsequent clinical trials8\u201311 in patients with *BRAF*V600-mutant melanoma have shown that dual MAPK-pathway targeting with a BRAF inhibitor and a MEK inhibitor improves efficacy and ameliorates paradoxical MAPK activation-related toxic effects associated with BRAFinhibitor monotherapy. Two BRAF-MEK inhibitor combinations (dabrafenib-trametinib and vemurafenibcobimetinib) are regarded as treatment options for metastatic or unresectable *BRAF*V600-mutant melanoma in current guidelines.12,13 These BRAF-MEK inhibitor combinations are highly effective. However, both are associated with disease progression at approximately 12 months, and each combination causes different toxic effects in patients, highlighting the need for more effective and better tolerated therapies.8\u201310,14\u201317\n\nEncorafenib is an ATP-competitive BRAF inhibitor that suppresses the MAPK pathway in tumour cells that express several mutated forms of BRAF kinase (eg, V600E, V600D, and V600K mutations), with a more than 10-times longer dissociation half-life (>30 h) than either dabrafenib or vemurafenib, which enables sustained target inhibition.18 Preclinical studies suggest that this property could enhance antitumour activity while reducing paradoxical activation of MAPK pathways in normal tissues.18,19 Binimetinib is an orally available, non-ATPcompetitive, allosteric inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2.20\n\nPromising clinical activity and tolerability of the combination of encorafenib and binimetinib has been seen in patients with *BRAF*V600-mutated melanoma in a phase 1b/2 and a phase 2 study. 21,22 Furthermore, the maximum tolerated dose of encorafenib when combined with binimetinib was higher than the maximum tolerated dose of encorafenib monotherapy, thus allowing the use of a higher encorafenib dose when combined with binimetinib in subsequent trials.22 Here, we describe the results of part one of the COLUMBUS trial, a phase 3 study of encorafenib plus binimetinib versus vemurafenib or encorafenib monotherapy in patients with advanced *BRAF*V600-mutant unresectable melanoma.\n\n# **Methods**\n\n## **Study design and participants**\n\nCOLUMBUS is a two-part, multicentre, randomised, open-label phase 3 study of the efficacy and safety of encorafenib plus binimetinib combination therapy versus vemurafenib or encorafenib monotherapy in patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic *BRAF*V600-mutant melanoma. The study was originally designed to compare the efficacy of encorafenib 450 mg once daily plus binimetinib 45 mg twice daily with vemurafenib given at its clinically indicated dose, and with encorafenib given at 300 mg once daily (its maximum well tolerated dose as a monotherapy). However, because of a request from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the study protocol was amended on Nov 4, 2014, and a new study phase (part two) was added to better understand and isolate the contribution of binimetinib to the combination by comparing encorafenib 300 mg plus binimetinib 45 mg against encorafenib 300 mg alone.\n\nIn part one of the study, patients were recruited at 162 hospitals in 28 countries, including 20 sites in North America, 124 sites in Europe, and 18 sites in other selected countries (appendix p 2\u20135). After completion of enrolment in part one, patients were recruited into part two of the study following the same eligibility criteria, and the combination of encorafenib at its monotherapy maximum tolerated dose plus binimetinib was compared with encorafenib monotherapy at the same dose. Part 2 was done to better characterise the contribution of binimetinib to the combination therapy, and the results will be published separately.\n\nTo be eligible, patients needed to be aged 18 years or older and meet the following criteria: have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV), unresectable or metastatic cutaneous melanoma, or unknown primary melanoma (as per amendment 3; Nov 4, 2014); have the presence of a *BRAF*V600E or *BRAF*V600K mutation, or both, in their tumour tissue; have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1; have adequate bone marrow, organ function (including cardiac function), and laboratory parameters (ie, absolute neutrophil count, haemoglobin concentration, platelet count, aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase concentrations, and total bilirubin, creatinine, or calculated creatinine clearance); have evidence of at least one measurable lesion as detected by radiological or photographic methods according to guidelines based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1;23 and be treatment naive or have progressed on or after previous first-line immunotherapy (acceptable test limits for laboratory parameters are in the appendix, p 6). Key exclusion criteria included untreated CNS lesions; uveal or mucosal melanoma; known positive serology for human immunodeficiency virus, or an active hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection, or both; history of leptomeningeal metastases; a history of, current evidence of, or risk of retinal vein occlusion; Gilbert's syndrome; previous treatment with a BRAF or MEK inhibitor; previous systemic chemotherapy (as per protocol amendment 2 on Dec 22, 2013, and clarified in amendment 3 on Nov 4, 2014), extensive radiotherapy, or use of an investigational agent other than previous immunotherapy for locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic melanoma (immunotherapy must have ended at least 6 weeks before randomisation); impaired cardiovascular function; uncontrolled arterial hypertension; and neuromuscular disorders associated with high concentrations of creatine kinase. The full list of exclusion criteria is in the study protocol (appendix p 93).\n\nIndependent ethics committees or review boards at each study site approved the study protocol and amendments 1\u20134. Conduct of the study conformed with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the ethical requirements outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients before screening procedures were initiated.\n\nSee **Online** for appendix\n\n## **Randomisation and masking**\n\nPatients were randomly allocated into one of the three treatment groups in the trial (1:1:1) to receive either encorafenib plus binimetinib (encorafenib plus binimetinib group), encorafenib (encorafenib group), or vemurafenib (vemurafenib group) by use of validated interactive response technology (Parexel International, Billerica, MA, USA). Randomisation was stratified by AJCC stage (IIIB, IIIC, IVM1a, IVM1b, or IVM1c), ECOG performance status (0 or 1), and *BRAF*-mutation status (*BRAF*V600E *vs BRAF*V600K). After protocol amendment 2 (Dec 20, 2013), previous first-line immunotherapy (yes *vs* no) replaced *BRAF*-mutation status as a stratification factor. Investigators and patients were not masked to treatment assignment.\n\n## **Procedures**\n\nCentral genetic mutation analysis to ascertain the presence of *BRAF* mutations was done for all patients before enrolment with the bioM\u00e9rieux THxID BRAF diagnostic test (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France), which identifies both *BRAF*V600E and *BRAF*V600K gene mutations. Instances of previous immunotherapy were recorded for all patients. Patients received either encorafenib 450 mg orally once daily plus binimetinib 45 mg orally twice daily, encorafenib 300 mg orally once daily, or vemurafenib 960 mg orally twice daily according to randomised treatment assignment, and continued treatment until progression of disease per central review, death, unacceptable toxic effects, or withdrawal of consent. The type and frequency of clinical laboratory assessments are described in the appendix (p 10). Dose modifications, including treatment interruptions and dose reductions, were permitted for each of the drugs on the basis of tolerability and adverse events. Details regarding drug manufacture and permitted dose modifications are in the appendix (p 6).\n\nThe relative dose intensity was defined as 100 \u00d7 (the total cumulative dose a patient actually received while a on the study) divided by (the total cumulative dose a patient was scheduled to receive [ie, had they not had any dose adjustments or interruptions] while on the study).\n\nBaseline imaging was done within 21 days of randomisation and included chest, abdomen, and pelvis MRI or CT, and brain MRI or CT to assess CNS disease. In the case of suspected bone metastases, a whole-body bone scan was done. Localised CT, MRI, or radiography was done for all skeletal lesions identified via the bone scan if not visible on the chest, abdomen, and pelvis CT or MRI. If clinically indicated, a CT or MRI scan was done of other areas of disease, as appropriate. Colour photographs were taken of all skin lesions, and lesion sizes were estimated with a metric ruler. Tumours were evaluated every 8 weeks during the first 24 months, and every 12 weeks thereafter, by use of the same imaging method as at baseline. Additional tumour assessments were done if progression was suspected by the treating physician. Tumour response was assessed centrally by blinded independent committee review and by local review according to guidelines based on RECIST version 1.1.\n\nFor safety assessments, we collected data on all adverse events; physical examinations such as specific ophthalmic and dermatological examinations, cardiac assessments (electrocardiogram and multiple-gated acquisition scan or echocardiogram); and clinical laboratory assessments. Because of the ocular-related toxicity profile of MEK inhibitors, all patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group had routine ophthalmic testing at each regularly scheduled visit during the treatment period**.** For patients in the encorafenib and vemurafenib groups, ophthalmic testing at each regularly scheduled visit was only required if retinal abnormalities were present at baseline. Details on the ophthalmological examinations are included in the appendix (p 6). The severity of adverse events was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03.24 We monitored adverse events during the study and for at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug.\n\nThe data cutoff date for analyses presented here was May 19, 2016. No interim analysis was done before the primary progression-free survival analysis presented in this Article. A data monitoring committee reviewed safety data approximately every 6 months.\n\n## **Outcomes**\n\nThe primary endpoint was the comparison of progressionfree survival in the encorafenib plus binimetinib versus vemurafenib groups as assessed by blinded independent central review. Progression-free survival was defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the date of the first documented disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. If a patient did not have a progression event at the time of the analysis cutoff or at the start of any new antineoplastic therapy, their data were censored at the date of last adequate tumour assessment. The key secondary endpoint was comparison of progression-free survival in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group versus the encorafenib group. Other secondary endpoints included comparison of the progression-free survival of patients in the encorafenib group versus the vemurafenib group; best overall response (complete response, partial response, stable disease, progressive disease, or unknown, derived per RECIST version 1.1), overall response (proportion of patients with a best overall response of confirmed complete response or partial response), disease control (the proportion of patients with a best overall response of confirmed complete response, partial response, or stable disease [including patients with non-measurable disease]), duration of response (time from the date of first documented response [confirmed complete response or partial response] to the first documented progression or death due to melanoma), time to response (time between date of randomisation until first documented response of complete response or partial response), and safety of encorafenib plus binimetinib and encorafenib. Data from tumour assessments read by blinded independent central review were used for the primary and secondary endpoints and analysis of best overall response, duration of response, and disease control; data from local review were used in supportive analyses. Analyses of other secondary outcomes to be reported in a separate manuscript include overall survival, quality of life, resource utilisation, comparison of ECOG performance status, and pharmacokinetic analysis.\n\n## **Statistical analysis**\n\nSample size calculations were based on assumptions for progression-free survival medians derived from results of a phase 1b/2 study (NCT01543698)22 for encorafenib plus binimetinib, a phase 1 study for encorafenib,18 and updated results from the BRIM-325 and BRIM-226/ COMBI-v,9 and coBRIM14,27 trials for vemurafenib.\n\nAnalyses of the primary and key (type-I error controlled) secondary endpoints for part one of the study were event driven and done when patient enrolment in part one was complete and the prespecified number of progressionfree survival events for both the final primary and part one key secondary comparison were available. We used a hierarchical testing procedure to control type-I errors for the primary and key secondary endpoints. The key secondary endpoint of part one (progression-free survival of encorafenib plus binimetinib *vs* encorafenib) was to be tested if the primary efficacy endpoint (progression-free survival of encorafenib plus binimetinib *vs* vemurafenib) was significant. The driver of sample size was the key secondary endpoint of progression-free survival with encorafenib plus binimetinib versus encorafenib (as per amendment 3; appendix p 47); for this comparison, 191 progression-free survival events were required to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0\u00b7667 with 80% power by use of a log-rank test at a one-sided 2\u00b75% level of significance. For the primary comparisons of encorafenib plus binimetinib versus vemurafenib, 145 progressionfree survival events were required to detect an HR of 0\u00b758 with 90% power by use of a log-rank test at a one-sided 2\u00b75% level of significance. Assuming that 15% of patients would be lost to follow-up, we estimated that 576 patients (192 in each group) would need to be recruited.\n\nWe analysed efficacy endpoints in the intention-to-treat population, which comprised all patients who had been randomised. Patients were analysed by treatment group and strata, as assigned during randomisation. Safety was analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one postbaseline safety assessment; patients were analysed according to the treatment they actually received. All data were used to the greatest extent possible without imputations for missing data (appendix p 7).\n\nMedian duration of follow-up for progression-free survival was estimated first, by summarising the observed follow-up for each patient (ie, the duration from date of randomisation to date of progression-free survival event or censoring), and second, through reverse Kaplan-Meier analyses. The reverse Kaplan-Meier median values are reported and reflect the potential follow-up in the absence of progressive disease or death. Progression-free survival was analysed according to the treatment group and two of the stratification factors (AJCC stage and ECOG performance status). Owing to the low expected prevalence of patients with previous immunotherapy (about 15%), for the stratified analyses it was prespecified that the two previous immunotherapy strata (yes *vs* no)\n\n![](_page_4_Figure_5.jpeg)\n\n#### *Figure 1:* **Trial profile**\n\nCNS=central nervous system. \\*Some patients were ineligible for more than one reason. \u2020Primary reason. \u2021Ongoing at

Comparison of the distribution of progression-free survival used a stratified log-rank test (for the purposes of this summary, two-sided p values are reported). We presented the distribution of progression-free survival using the Kaplan-Meier method. We used stratified Cox regression models to estimate the HRs for progression-free survival, along with 95% CIs based on the Wald test. Sensitivity analyses were also prespecified. Prespecified sensitivity analyses examined different censoring rules, unstratified analyses, analyses of progression-free survival based on local tumour assessments, and analyses of the per-protocol population (appendix p 7). Subgroup analyses of baseline variables and potential prognostic factors, including previous immunotherapy, were also prespecified. We confirmed the proportional hazards assumption of the Cox models graphically with plots of log(\u2212log[estimated survivor function]) versus log(time). We used the same methods for the key secondary comparison. We presented the overall response and disease control by treatment group with exact 95% CIs. Duration of response and time to response were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology. As part of the secondary outcome of encorafenib plus binimetinib and encorafenib safety, we summarised the time to first event using Kaplan-Meier methodology for several prespecified safety parameters. Median time to onset and 95% CIs were summarised, and we described other median values with 95% CIs or IQRs. We included nominal p values for secondary endpoints for descriptive purposes.\n\nSAS (version 9.2 or higher) was used for all analyses. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01909453, and with EudraCT, number 2013-001176-38.\n\n# **Role of the funding source**\n\nThe study was sponsored and designed with input from the steering committee (RD, PAA, CR, and KTF) by Novartis until September, 2015, when sponsorship was transferred to Array BioPharma. Data were collected by Novartis and Array BioPharma during their respective sponsorships. Data were analysed by Array BioPharma's statistical team and interpreted by the study authors in collaboration with Array BioPharma. RD, PAA, CR, and KTF wrote the first draft of the report. Editorial support was funded by the study sponsor. RD, PAA, CR, and KTF had full access to all the data in the study, and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\n\n# **Results**\n\nBetween Dec 30, 2013, and April 10, 2015, 1345 patients were assessed, of whom 577 were enrolled and randomly assigned to a treatment group (192 to the encorafenib plus binimetinib group, 194 to the encorafenib group, and 191 to the vemurafenib group; figure 1). As of the data cutoff on May 19, 2016, treatment was ongoing in 68 (35%) of 192 patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group, 46 (24%) of 194 patients in the encorafenib group, and 27 (14%) of 191 patients in the vemurafenib group. Demographic and clinical characteristics, including key prognostic factors at baseline, were similar across treatment groups (table 1). Patients had extensive disease, with 368 (64%) of 577 patients overall having stage IVM1c disease and 260 (45%) having three or more organs involved. 172 (30%) patients overall had previously had immunotherapy and 26 (5%) patients had previously had checkpoint inhibitor therapy.\n\nThe date for the data cutoff was event driven on the basis of achieving the required number of progression events for both the primary (encorafenib plus binimetinib *vs* vemurafenib) and key secondary (encorafenib plus binimetinib *vs* encorafenib) comparisons. At the time of data cutoff, 98 events for the encorafenib plus binimetinib group, 96 events for the encorafenib group, and 106 events for the vemurafenib group contributed to the analysis of progression-free survival. Median follow-up was 16\u00b77 months (95% CI 16\u00b73\u201318\u00b74) for the encorafenib plus binimetinib group, 16\u00b76 months (14\u00b78\u201318\u00b71) for the encorafenib group, and 14\u00b74 months (10\u00b71\u201316\u00b76) for the vemurafenib group; median follow-up for all patients was 16\u00b76 months (14\u00b78\u201316\u00b79). The duration of progression-free survival, by summary of the observed follow-up for each patient and by reverse Kaplan-Meier analysis, is in the appendix (p 11).\n\nMedian progression-free survival assessed by blinded independent central review was longer for patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group (14\u00b79 months, 95% CI 11\u00b70\u201318\u00b75) than for those in the encorafenib (9\u00b76 months, 7\u00b75\u201314\u00b78) or vemurafenib (7\u00b73 months, 5\u00b76\u20138\u00b72) groups. Results of the per-protocol analyses were consistent (appendix p 12). Median progression-free survival by local review was similar: 14\u00b78 months (95% CI 10\u00b74\u201318\u00b74) for the encorafenib plus binimetinib group, 9\u00b72 months (7\u00b74\u201312\u00b79) for the encorafenib group, and 7\u00b73 months (5\u00b77\u20138\u00b75) for the vemurafenib group (appendix p 23).\n\nThe primary comparison of progression-free survival by blinded independent central review of the encorafenib plus binimetinib versus vemurafenib groups showed a significant reduction in the risk of progression or death (HR 0\u00b754, 95% CI 0\u00b741\u20130\u00b771; two-sided p<0\u00b70001; figure 2A). Progression-free survival by local review was similarly improved with encorafenib plus binimetinib versus vemurafenib (0\u00b749, 0\u00b737\u20130\u00b764; two-sided nominal p<0\u00b70001; appendix p 23). All subgroup analyses for the comparison of encorafenib plus binimetinib with vemurafenib showed point estimates in favour of the encorafenib plus binimetinib group, except for the presence of brain metastases at baseline, but this analysis included only nine patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group and three patients in the vemurafenib group (figure 3).\n\nThe key secondary comparison of progression-free survival by blinded independent central review showed a median of 14\u00b79 (95% CI 11\u00b70\u201318\u00b75) months in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group and 9\u00b76 (7\u00b75\u201314\u00b78) months in the encorafenib group (HR 0\u00b775, 95% CI 0\u00b756\u2013 1\u00b700; two-sided p=0\u00b7051; figure 2B). Progression-free survival by local assessment showed a larger treatment effect for the encorafenib plus binimetinib group than for the encorafenib group (0\u00b768, 95% CI 0\u00b752\u20130\u00b790; two-sided nominal p=0\u00b70064; appendix p 23). In other secondary endpoints, comparison of progression-free survival by blinded independent central review favoured the encorafenib group over the vemurafenib group (0\u00b768, 95% CI 0\u00b752\u20130\u00b790; two-sided nominal p=0\u00b70070); similar results were obtained by local assessment (appendix p 24).\n\nA confirmed overall response by blinded independent central review occurred in 121 (63%) of 192 patients in the\n\n![](_page_6_Figure_6.jpeg)\n\n*Figure 2:* **Kaplan-Meier curves of progression-free survival for encorafenib 450 mg plus binimetinib 45 mg versus vemurafenib 960 mg (A) and encorafenib 450 mg plus binimetinib 45 mg versus encorafenib 300 mg (B)**\n\nResponse was assessed by blinded independent central review. HR=hazard ratio.\n\nencorafenib plus binimetinib group compared with 98 (51%) of 194 patients in the encorafenib group and 77 (40%) of 191 patients in the vemurafenib group (table 2). The confirmed overall response by local review had a similar pattern but was higher in each group than in the central review (table 2). The median time to response by blinded independent central review in responding patients corresponded to the time of the first assessment and was 1\u00b78 months (95% CI 1\u00b78\u20131\u00b79) for the encorafenib plus binimetinib group, 1\u00b79 months (1\u00b79\u20131\u00b79) for the encorafenib group, and 1\u00b79 months (1\u00b78\u20131\u00b79) for the vemurafenib group. Median duration of confirmed objective response by blinded independent central review was 16\u00b76 months (12\u00b72\u201320\u00b74) for the encorafenib plus binimetinib group, 14\u00b79 months (11\u00b71\u2013not estimable) for the encorafenib group, and 12\u00b73 months (6\u00b79\u201316\u00b79) for the vemurafenib group.\n\nIn the encorafenib plus binimetinib group, the median duration of

\n\nProgression-free survival assessed by blinded independent central review. Comparisons are between the encorafenib 450 mg plus binimetinib 45 mg group and the vemurafenib 960 mg group. Other subgroup analyses (excluded from this figure because of the small number [fewer than ten patients] included within one of the two subgroup categories) are in the appendix (p 9).

Median duration of treatment was 31\u00b74 weeks (16\u00b76\u201369\u00b71) in the encorafenib group and 27\u00b71 weeks (15\u00b71\u201348\u00b73) in the vemurafenib group. The median dose intensities in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group were\n\n100% (IQR 93\u2013100) of planned doses for encorafenib and 99\u00b76% (80\u2013100) of planned doses for binimetinib. Median dose intensity was 86% (55\u2013100) of the planned dose for encorafenib and 94% (74\u2013100) for vemurafenib. The distribution of dose intensity for each treatment group is shown in the appendix (p 25). Most of the 192 patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group were able to achieve a dose intensity of 80\u2013100% (152 [79%] for encorafenib and 144 [75%] for binimetinib), and few patients receiving the combination were given less than 50% dose intensity (five [3%] for encorafenib and 11 [6%] for binimetinib). By contrast, 98 (51%) of 192 patients in the encorafenib group and 116 (62%) of 186 patients in the vemurafenib group achieved a dose intensity of 80\u2013100%, and 42 (22%) in the encorafenib group and 13 (7%) in the vemurafenib group achieved a dose intensity of less than 50% (appendix p 25).\n\n192 patients were assessable for safety in both the encorafenib plus binimetinib and encorafenib groups, and 186 patients in the vemurafenib group. Grade 1 or 2 adverse events occurring in at least 10% of patients and grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurring in at least 2% of patients in any treatment group are summarised in table 3 (the appendix [p 13] lists all grade 3\u20134 adverse events in the treatment groups; as per the study protocol, deaths were not graded and therefore were not included in table 3). Common adverse events reported more frequently in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group than in the encorafenib or vemurafenib groups (with a difference in proportion of patients of 10% or higher) were gastrointestinal toxic effects (diarrhoea, constipation, vomiting, and abdominal pain), predominantly asymptomatic increases in creatine phosphokinase, and blurred vision. Common adverse events reported at a lower frequency (with a difference in proportion of patients of 10% or higher) in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group than in the encorafenib or vemurafenib groups were toxic effects to the skin (eg, pruritus, hyperkeratosis, rash, keratosis pilaris, palmoplantar keratoderma, palmoplantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome, dry skin, skin papilloma, macropapular rash, and sunburn), alopecia, photosensitivity reaction, arthralgia, myalgia, pain in the extremities, decreased appetite, musculoskeletal pain, and decreased weight.\n\nGrade 3\u20134 adverse events were reported in fewer patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group (111 [58%] of 192) than in either the encorafenib (127 [66%] of 192) or vemurafenib (118 [63%] of 186) groups. The most common grade 3\u20134 adverse events seen in more than 5% of patients were increased \u03b3-glutamyltransferase (18 [9%] of 192 patients), increased creatine phosphokinase (13 [7%]), and hypertension (11 [6%]) in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group; palmoplantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (26 [14%] of 192 patients), myalgia (19 [10%]), and arthralgia (18 [9%]) in the encorafenib group; and arthralgia (11 [6%] of 186 patients) in the vemurafenib group. The median time to first grade 3 or 4 toxic effect in all patients who could be evaluated for safety was longer\n\n|                       | Encorafenib 450 mg plus<br>binimetinib 45 mg group (n=192) |                  | Encorafenib 300 mg group (n=194) |                  | Vemurafenib 960 mg group (n=191) |                  |  |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|------------------|--|\n|                       | Central review                                             | Local review     | Central review                   | Local review     | Central review                   | Local review     |  |\n| Best overall response |                                                            |                  |                                  |                  |                                  |                  |  |\n| Complete response     | 15 (8%)                                                    | 31 (16%)         | 10 (5%)                          | 17 (9%)          | 11 (6%)                          | 14 (7%)          |  |\n| Partial response      | 106 (55%)                                                  | 113 (59%)        | 88 (45%)                         | 95 (49%)         | 66 (35%)                         | 80 (42%)         |  |\n| Stable disease*       | 56 (29%)                                                   | 35 (18%)         | 65 (34%)                         | 56 (29%)         | 79 (41%)                         | 66 (35%)         |  |\n| Progressive disease\u2020  | 15 (8%)                                                    | 13 (7%)          | 31 (16%)                         | 26 (13%)         | 35 (18%)                         | 31 (16%)         |  |\n| Overall response\u2021     | 121 (63%; 56\u201370)                                           | 144 (75%; 68\u201381) | 98 (51%; 43\u201358)                  | 112 (58%; 50\u201365) | 77 (40%; 33\u201348)                  | 94 (49%; 42\u201357)  |  |\n| Disease control\u00a7      | 177 (92%; 87\u201396)                                           | 179 (93%; 89\u201396) | 163 (84%; 78\u201389)                 | 168 (87%; 81\u201391) | 156 (82%; 75\u201387)                 | 160 (84%; 78\u201389) |  |\n\nData are n (%) or n (%; 95% CI) in the efficacy population. \\*Includes patients with non-measurable disease and a status of non-complete response or non-progressive disease. \u2020Includes patients with best response of unknown or no assessment. \u2021Overall response was defined as complete response plus partial response. \u00a7Disease control defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response of complete response, partial response, stable disease, or non-complete response or non-progressive disease.\n\n*Table 2:* **Best overall confirmed response by treatment group**\n\nwithin the encorafenib plus binimetinib group than within the encorafenib or vemurafenib groups (appendix p 26).

Time to discontinuation of treatment due to an adverse event was longer with encorafenib plus binimetinib than with encorafenib or vemurafenib (appendix p 26). Adverse events leading to discontinuation that were suspected to be related to study treatment occurred in 12 (6%) patients given encorafenib plus binimetinib, 19 (10%) given encorafenib, and 26 (14%) given vemurafenib (data not shown). The most frequent of these suspected treatmentrelated adverse events in each group were increased alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase (co-occurring in the same four [2%] patients) in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group, palmoplantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (five [3%] patients) in the encorafenib group, and increased \u03b3-glutamyltransferase, arthralgia, and photosensitivity reacti  # Increased text length for comprehensive extraction\n\nReturn JSON only:",

Luke, MD10\n\nabstract PURPOSE Combination of antiprogrammed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) plus anti\u2013cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte-4 (anti-CTLA-4) immunotherapy shows greater response rates (RRs) than anti-PD-1 antibody alone in melanoma, but RR after initial anti-PD-1 and programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody progression awaits robust investigation. Anti-CTLA-4 antibody alone after anti-PD-1/L1 antibody progression has a historical RR of 13%. We report the results of the first prospective clinical trial evaluating ipilimumab 1 mg/kg plus pembrolizumab following progression on anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.\n\nMETHODS Patients with advanced melanoma who had progressed on anti-PD-1/L1 antibody as immediate prior therapy (including non\u2013anti-CTLA-4 antibody combinations) were eligible. Patients received pembrolizumab 200 mg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg once every 3 weeks for four doses, followed by pembrolizumab monotherapy. The primary end point was RR by irRECIST. After 35 patients, the trial met the primary end point and was expanded to enroll a total of 70 patients to better estimate the RR.\n\nRESULTS Prior treatments included 60 on anti-PD-1 antibody alone and 10 on anti-PD-1/L1 antibody\u2013based combinations. Thirteen patients had progressed in the adjuvant setting. The median length of prior treatment with anti-PD-1/L1 antibody was 4.8 months. Response assessments included five complete and 15 partial responses, making the irRECIST RR 29% among the entire trial population. The median progression-free survival was 5.0 months, and the median overall survival was 24.7 months. The median duration of response was 16.6 months. There was no difference in median time on prior anti-PD1/L1 or time to PD1 1 CTLA4 initiation between responders and nonresponders. Grade 3-4 drug-related adverse events occurred in 27% of patients. Responses occurred in PD-L1\u2013negative, non-T-cell\u2013inflamed, and intermediate tumor phenotypes.\n\nCONCLUSION To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study in melanoma of pembrolizumab plus low-dose ipilimumab after anti-PD-1/L1 immunotherapy failure, demonstrating significant antitumor activity and tolerability.\n\nJ Clin Oncol 39:2647-2655. \u00a9 2021 by American Society of Clinical Oncology\n\n# INTRODUCTION\n\nFor patients with advanced melanoma, the introduction of targeted and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies has greatly improved systemic therapy outcomes.[1](#page-7-0) With antibodies against the immune checkpoints cytotoxic T-lymphocyte\u2013associated antigen 4 (anti\u2013cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte-4 [CTLA-4]; ipilimumab) and programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1; pembrolizumab and nivolumab), some patients have achieved long-term disease control, with 5 year survival rates ranging from 34% to 52%.[2](#page-7-1),[3](#page-7-2) Combination immunotherapy using both anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies demonstrates a numerically higher response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) relative to anti-PD-1 antibody monotherapy, but with a grade 3-4 toxicity rate of up to 59%.[4](#page-7-3) This has prompted many treating oncologists to begin with single-agent anti-PD-1 therapy, with the prospect of using ipilimumab in the second line upon treatment failure.\n\nHowever, in patients who have experienced tumor progression on anti-PD-1 and programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody monotherapy, no prospective trials of ipilimumab or an anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4\n\nASSOCIATED CONTENT See accompanying editorial on page [2637](http://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JCO.21.00943) Appendix [Protocol](https://ascopubs.org/doi/suppl/10.1200/JCO.21.00079)\n\nAuthor affiliations and support information (if applicable) appear at the end of this article.

Grade 3-4 adverse events occurred in 27% of patients, and responses occurred primarily among PD-L1\u2013negative, non-T-cell\u2013inflamed, and intermediate tumor phenotypes.\n\n# Relevance\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first prospective study in melanoma of pembrolizumab plus low-dose ipilimumab after anti-PD-1/L1 immunotherapy failure, demonstrating significant antitumor activity and tolerability.\n\nantibody combination exist. Post hoc assessment of 97 patients who crossed over to ipilimumab directly after pembrolizumab in the randomized phase III KEYNOTE-006 trial demonstrated a 13% objective response rate (ORR)[.5](#page-7-4) Similarly, a retrospective review of treatment outcomes in 355 patients with progression on an anti-PD-1/L1 antibody demonstrated that those who subsequently received ipilimumab achieved an RR of 13% versus 32% in those who received ipilimumab of dose 3 mg/kg once every 3 weeks for four doses plus an anti-PD-1/L1 antibody. The OS also appeared to favor the combination group at 20.4 months versus 8.8 months, respectively.[6](#page-7-5) These findings support the hypothesis that combined PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibition can be effective after progression on a prior anti-PD-1/L1. The use of this combination in the second line might also theoretically spare the higher toxicity rate for patients who only required single-agent anti-PD-1 therapy for disease control.\n\nDespite demonstrating the highest ORR, PFS, and OS, the combination of nivolumab plus ipilimumab at 3 mg/kg treatment is not uniformly used in advanced melanoma because of serious immune-related adverse events.[4](#page-7-3) A strategy for mitigating toxicity with this combination immunotherapy is administration of low-dose ipilimumab, 1 mg/kg, in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody. The randomized Checkmate-511 study compared nivolumab with ipilimumab at 1 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg, demonstrating that high-grade adverse events (grades 3-5) occurred in 34% versus 48% of patients, respectively, whereas exploratory efficacy outcomes were similar.[7](#page-7-6) No prospective studies have yet described the utility of anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4 antibody therapy following progression on anti-PD-1/L1 monotherapy.\n\nMultiple biomarkers of anti-PD-1 treatment response, such as PD-L1 immunohistochemistry and gene expression profiling centered on interferon-associated transcripts, have been identified to stratify immunotherapy treatment outcomes. T-cell\u2013inflamed gene expression, which more broadly describes the tumor microenvironment than PD-L1 staining alone, perhaps has the strongest predictive association with response in melanoma.[8](#page-7-7) Immunotherapy biomarkers have been predominately explored in the treatment-na\u00a8\u0131ve setting, and it remains unclear what relationship these biomarkers have with response after failure on an anti-PD-1/L1 antibody.\n\nHerein, we report outcomes from a phase II clinical trial for the combination of pembrolizumab plus low-dose ipilimumab following progression on an anti-PD-1/L1 antibody in advanced melanoma. We also report baseline tumor biomarkers of clinical response to this combination immunotherapy regimen.\n\n# METHODS\n\n# Study Design and Participants\n\nIn this open-label, single-arm phase II trial, we recruited patients from seven medical centers across the United States. Eligible adult patients had unresectable or metastatic melanoma with known BRAF mutation status, uveal melanoma excluded, measurable disease according to immune-related RECIST (irRECIST) version 1.1,[9](#page-7-8) and adequate organ function and performance status. Patients with previous grade 3-4 toxicity from anti-PD-1/L1 antibody therapy leading to treatment discontinuation were excluded. All patients must have experienced disease progression during treatment with an anti-PD-1/L1 antibody immediately before accrual to this study or disease progression within 6 months of adjuvant anti-PD-1 antibody without intercurrent therapy. For patients without clear clinical progression on the prior anti-PD-1/L1 antibody, a confirmatory scan was recommended but not required. Patients with active CNS metastases were excluded (previously treated, stable CNS disease allowed); no prior anti-CTLA-4 antibody use in the metastatic setting was permitted. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in the study Protocol (online only [pp 12-15]). The study Protocol was reviewed and approved by the appropriate institutional review boards at each participating site. We conducted the study in accordance with the Protocol with subsequent amendments and with the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent.\n\n# Procedures\n\nPatients received pembrolizumab (200 mg) intravenously along with low-dose ipilimumab (1 mg/kg) intravenously once every 3 weeks for four doses, followed by pembrolizumab intravenously 200 mg once every 3 weeks for up to 2 years. Treatment continued until confirmed radiographic disease progression, intolerable toxicity, patient withdrawal of consent, investigator decision, or completion of therapy. Per irRECIST, patients with initial evidence of radiographic progression were allowed to continue through to a second confirmatory scan to account for tumor flare; however, patients with evidence of clinical deterioration or clear objective disease progression, as assessed by the treating physician, were not required to have repeat imaging for confirmation of progressive disease. Study treatments continued for up to 2 years, although patients who attained a complete response confirmed on at least two scans after a minimum of 24 weeks of study treatment could discontinue treatment early. Full discontinuation criteria are included in the study Protocol (pp 25-26). No dose reductions of pembrolizumab or ipilimumab were permitted.\n\nImmunohistochemistry for tumor PD-L1 expression and gene expression profiling were performed on archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE). Full methods for PD-L1 scoring, as well as procedures for RNA extraction and gene expression profiling by RNAseq, are included in the [Appendix](#page-10-0) (online only).\n\nFormal clinical assessments of response were completed per irRECIST version 1.1 before initiation of study therapy and every 12 weeks thereafter, with intervals of at least every 3 weeks required for confirmation of disease progression. At all treatment and follow-up visits, we assessed physical examination status, vital signs, and laboratory values. Adverse events were documented according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0.\n\n# Outcome Analysis\n\nThe primary objective of this study was to determine the ORR of pembrolizumab with low-dose ipilimumab following initial progression on an anti-PD-1/L1 antibody in advanced melanoma. Secondary objectives included summarizing PFS (defined as time on study treatment until immunerelated progressive disease, clear clinical progression, or death) and safety. Exploratory objectives included associations of baseline tumor gene expression patterns with clinical outcomes. Although not prespecified end points in the study Protocol, OS (defined as the time from enrollment to death from any cause) and duration of response (DOR; defined as the time from first evidence of response until disease progression or death) were also assessed.\n\n# Statistical Analysis\n\nThe initial design of this study sought to test a null hypothesis of a 10% RR (based on known historical controls for ipilimumab) versus a 30% alternative.[5](#page-7-4) Simon's optimal two-stage design was initially employed to enroll up to a total of 35 patients. In the first stage, 12 patients were enrolled with two responses required to initiate the second stage, where a total of 35 patients would be enrolled (one-sided alpha .10, 90% power). Given the investigator-initiated and open-label nature of the study, no formal accrual hold was planned for interim analysis. It was observed that two patients responded within the first five patients accrued and there were seven responders in the first 12 patients of the Simon design. The primary end point for the total study was met when eight responses were observed in the first 17 patients, after which the trial was expanded to enroll a total of 70 patients in an exploratory manner to better describe the ORR in this population.[10](#page-7-9) We assessed ORR and, using the Kaplan-Meier method, estimated PFS and OS in all enrolled patients as well as DOR in patients achieving a partial or complete response. We provided descriptive statistics for baseline patient characteristics and for adverse events. Frequency of adverse events for each grade level was recorded among all patients receiving at least one dose of study therapy.\n\nAvailable tumor specimens were analyzed for PD-L1 expression and gene expression profiling; these biomarkers were then compared with clinical response outcomes. We used a previously described T-cell inflammation score,[11](#page-7-10) which correlates with other validated interferon-g gene signatures [\\(Appendix\\)](#page-10-0).[12](#page-7-11) This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: [NCT02743819.](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02743819) The trial is closed to enrollment, but patients remain on treatment and in observation for safety and ongoing response assessments.\n\n# RESULTS\n\nFrom December 9, 2016 to November 4, 2019, 70 patients were enrolled and treated with at least one dose of pembrolizumab plus low-dose ipilimumab. Before enrollment, the median time on prior anti-PD-1/L1 antibody was 4.8 months (Appendix [Fig A1,](#page-10-1) online only). Thirteen study patients (19%) progressed previously in the adjuvant setting. Two patients received adjuvant ipilimumab and completed this treatment 15 and 22 months before receiving an anti-PD-1/L1 antibody. Progression to prior anti-PD-1/L1 therapy was determined by confirmatory scans in 55 (79%) patients and by assessment of clinical progression by the treating physician in 15 (21%) patients. Most patients were male and had cutaneous melanoma; 20 patients (29%) had BRAFV600 mutations. Additionally, 34 patients (49%) had M1c or M1d disease, and 22 patients (31%) had elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations ([Table 1\\)](#page-3-0).\n\n<span id=\"page-3-0\"></span>TABLE 1.

Fifty-three patients (76%) received four or more doses of pembrolizumab plus lowdose ipilimumab. Of those who did not complete four cycles of study therapy, the median number of cycles was 2 (IQR, 1.75-2.25) and reasons for discontinuation among these patients were progressive disease (n 5 11), adverse events (n 5 4), and death (n 5 2). For patients continuing pembrolizumab monotherapy, the median number of cycles was 9 (IQR, 5.0-15.8).\n\nTwenty of 70 enrolled patients (29%) achieved a confirmed response (95% CI, 18.4 to 40.6), including five complete (7.2%) and 15 partial responses (21.4%) [\\(Fig 1\\)](#page-4-0). Three additional patients had unconfirmed responses, all with subsequent disease progression. Eight patients were nonevaluable for radiographic assessment of the primary end point but are included in the overall analysis for ORR (as nonresponders) and secondary end points. Of the eight nonevaluable patients, five had clear clinical progression before first response assessment, two patients died of complications related to disease progression before restaging, and one patient withdrew consent after experiencing grade three immune-related hepatitis after one dose of study therapy. The median PFS was 5 months (95% CI, 2.8 to 8.3). In responding patients, the median DOR was 16.6 months (95% CI, 7.9 to not reached). The median OS was 24.7 months (95% CI, 15.2 to not reached) (Appendix [Fig A2](#page-11-0), online only). At the time of data lock, 14 of 20 responses (70%) were ongoing.\n\nResponses were observed across clinical and biomarker subgroups ([Table 2](#page-5-0)), including patients who progressed on an anti-PD-1/L1 antibody in the adjuvant setting (two of 13 [15%]), patients with liver metastases and previously treated CNS metastases (six of 25 [17%]), and patients with an elevated LDH at study entry (six of 22 [27%]). No association between time on prior anti-PD-1/L1 antibody therapy and subsequent response to study therapy was observed. The median time between prior anti-PD-1/L1 treatments and initiating pembrolizumab plus low-dose ipilimumab was 1.5 months in responders vs 1.4 months in nonresponders. More responses were observed in PD-L1\u2013negative archival tumors (15 of 39 [38%]) as compared with PD-L1\u2013positive archival tumors (four of 27 [15%]). T-cell\u2013inflamed gene expression scores were calculated across all patients with archival tissue adequate for RNA extraction (n 5 58). Two T-cell\u2013inflamed tumors were observed among the 20 responders, with the remainder being either non-T-cell\u2013inflamed or intermediate ([Table 3\\)](#page-5-1).\n\nTreatment-related adverse events occurred in 62 of 70 patients (87%), with the most frequent events being pruritis, rash, diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, and transaminase elevations [\\(Table 4\\)](#page-6-0). Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 19 of 70 patients (27%), with the most common being colitis or diarrhea, rash, and transaminase elevations. Only one patient experienced a grade four treatment-related adverse event, which was a concurrent lipase elevation in a patient with grade three pancreatitis.\n\n![](_page_4_Figure_3.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-4-0\"></span>FIG 1.

Responses were observed in 29% of all study patients. Responses are ongoing in 70% of responding patients, with a median response duration of 16.6 months. Responses were also observed across all clinical subgroups, including patients with elevated LDH and brain and liver metastases and in patients who progressed on an anti-PD-1/L1 antibody in the adjuvant setting. Most responses were observed among patients who progressed on a prior anti-PD-1/L1 antibody within 6 months, although responses were also observed among those with longer prior treatment. Additionally, these responses occurred predominantly among patients with intermediate to non-T-cell\u2013inflamed and PD-L1\u2013negative tumors. The study regimen showed a relatively low rate of toxicity, with grade 3-4 adverse events occurring in 27% of all study patients.\n\nProlonged response, even after cessation of therapy, is a hallmark feature of immune checkpoint inhibitors.[3](#page-7-2)[,13](#page-7-12) The durable responses observed with pembrolizumab plus lowdose ipilimumab suggest that this benefit may carry forward when using an anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4 antibody combination after anti-PD-1 antibody failure. These findings may be particularly informative for future drug development after failure of an anti-PD-1/L1 antibody by setting an important benchmark for therapies in this space.\n\nAlthough high rates of toxicity have previously limited safe delivery of anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4 combinations, the 27% grade 3-4 adverse event rate observed with pembrolizumab plus low-dose ipilimumab reflects a comparatively manageable side effect profile. Currently, there is no prospective comparison of toxicity for anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibody combinations in the anti-PD-1/L1 antibody\u2013refractory setting, although high-grade toxicity rates in the anti-PD-1/L1 antibody\u2013na\u00a8\u0131ve setting surpass 50%[.4](#page-7-3) In this study, we used a 1 mg/kg dose of ipilimumab to mitigate such high rates of toxicity, while seeking to maintain antitumor activity, as this strategy has shown promise in the anti-PD-1/L1\u2013na\u00a8\u0131ve setting.[7](#page-7-6),[14](#page-7-13) The 1 mg/kg ipilimumab dose may, to an extent, explain the relatively favorable rates of toxicity observed with pembrolizumab plus low-dose ipilimumab. We would, however, make only cautious comparisons between toxicity rates between the anti-PD-1/L1 antibody\u2013refractory and antibody\u2013na\u00a8\u0131ve settings. As anti-PD-1/L1 antibody refractory patients who experienced high-grade toxicity were ineligible for our study, toxicity rates observed with ipilimumab combination in the anti-PD-1/L1 antibody\u2013refractory setting may be subject to this selection bias.\n\nResponses to pembrolizumab plus low-dose ipilimumab were observed predominantly among PD-L1\u2013negative and intermediate to non-T-cell\u2013inflamed tumors. This is contrary to what has been observed in the anti-PD-1/L1 antibody\u2013na\u00a8\u0131ve setting, where biomarkers of T-cell inflammation and PD-L1 expression enrich for response[.8](#page-7-7)[,15,](#page-7-14)[16](#page-8-0) Previously, MHC class II expression has been shown to predict\n\n<span id=\"page-6-0\"></span>TABLE 4.

This could explain in part why patients who benefited from pembrolizumab plus low-dose ipilimumab were found to have non-T-cell\u2013inflamed tumor phenotypes. It remains unclear, however, how the addition of ipilimumab drives antitumor responses after a failure of an anti-PD-1/L1 antibody. One possibility is that ipilimumab may enhance the development of de novo antitumor responses in the peripheral immune compartment and/or relieve independent mechanisms of resistance associated with PD-1/L1 expression in the tumor microenvironment. These hypotheses are supported by neoadjuvant ipilimumab studies in which an influx of CD8<sup>1</sup> T cells into the tumor microenvironment was observed after treatment[.20](#page-8-3) The exact immunologic mechanisms by which ipilimumab may facilitate these antitumor responses require further investigation.\n\nWe recognize that our study has certain limitations. Given the constraints of an uncontrolled study, we would await the randomized results of anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4 antibody combination after anti-PD-1 antibody failure to definitively make a claim of superiority for the combination regimen[.21](#page-8-4) Additionally, at the time this study began, there was not a formal consensus to define progression on an anti-PD-1/L1 antibody as it exists currently.[22](#page-8-5) In reviewing our study, 79% of patients had two scans to confirm progression on a prior anti-PD-1/L1 antibody, and for patients without confirmatory scans, treating physicians used their clinical judgment to ascertain a lack of benefit from the prior anti-PD-1/L1 antibody. Although RECIST 1.1 remains a predominant treatment response method, we chose irRECIST to more completely describe the clinical outcomes as the primary end point analysis for an immunotherapy trial. Regarding our observations surrounding lack of a T-cell\u2013inflamed tumor phenotype with response, these findings are predicated on baseline, archival FFPE tumor samples. Future studies incorporating pre- and on-treatment biopsies after anti-PD-1/L1 antibody failure will be helpful to fully characterize mechanisms of tumor microenvironment modulation by ipilimumab. We also recognize that in clinical practice, some patients may receive intercurrent BRAF-/ MEK-directed therapy after progression on an anti-PD-1/L1 antibody. Outcomes for this specific subgroup await further study.\n\nThe combination of pembrolizumab plus low-dose ipilimumab demonstrated significant antitumor activity and tolerability in a multicenter clinical trial. This study demonstrated long-term responses, suggesting that durable survival\u2014a hallmark of immunotherapy activity\u2014may be possible even after failure of an anti-PD-1/L1 antibody. These findings warrant further investigation and support the ongoing effort to directly compare combination of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies with ipilimumab alone in the anti-PD-1/L1 antibody\u2013refractory setting.\n\n# AFFILIATIONS\n\n1 University of Chicago Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chicago, IL 2 H.

The Cell Signaling Technology EIL3N programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) monoclonal antibody was used for PD-L1 scoring. This antibody has been previously validated for PD-L1 scoring and showed high concordance with commercially available PD-L1 antibodies, including DAKO 22C35.[23](#page-8-6) Tumor cells were scored by University of Chicago pathologists using the DAKO 22C3 method as taught in the interactive primer course on the DAKO 22C3 website; this method is employed as standard practice for PD-L1 scoring at the University of Chicago. A cutoff of \\$ 1% was used to define PD-L1 positivity as consistent with the melanoma KEYNOTE trials.\n\nRNA sequencing and gene expression profiling. Tumor RNA was isolated from available formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples using the QIAGEN AllPrep DNA/RNA FFPE kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) at the Human Immunologic Monitoring Facility at the University of Chicago according to the manufacturer's instruction. The quality and quantity of RNA were measured on an Agilent 2100 Bio-analyzer using Agilent reagents and protocols (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). RNAseq libraries were generated using Illumina TruSEQ Total RNA stranded library\u2013making kits using Illumina protocols (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The quality and quantity of the library were determined using an Agilent 2100 Bio-analyzer using Agilent reagents and protocols. Sequencing data were collected using an Illumina NovaSEQ sequencer and demultiplexed using Illumina bcl2fastq software. The quality of raw reads was assessed by FastQC[.24](#page-8-7) Reads were aligned to human reference transcriptome with Gencode gene annotation (GRCh38) by Kallisto.[25](#page-8-8) Transcript abundance was quantified at the transcript level using the strand-specific protocol, summarized into gene level using tximport[,26](#page-8-9) normalized by the trimmed mean of M values (TMM) method, and log2-transformed for further analysis. T-cell\u2013inflamed gene expression scores were determined using a 160-gene signature of T-cell inflammation[,11](#page-7-10) and the expression for each gene was normalized to its mean expression level by subtracting the average value and dividing by the standard deviation, such that the average value of the normalized data was 0 and the standard deviation was 1. T-cell\u2013inflamed gene expression scores were calculated by taking the median of the normalized values for each gene in the signature. Of the 58 tumor specimens with RNA adequate for analysis, 50 were obtained before initial anti-PD-1/L1 antibody treatment and eight were obtained after anti-PD-1/L1 antibody treatment, but before initiating study treatment with pembrolizumab plus low-dose ipilimumab.\n\n![](_page_10_Figure_6.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-10-1\"></span>FIG A1.

Anti-CTLA-4 antibody alone after anti-PD-1/L1 antibody progression has a historical RR of 13%. We report the results of the first prospective clinical trial evaluating ipilimumab 1 mg/kg plus pembrolizumab following progression on anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.\n\nMETHODS Patients with advanced melanoma who had progressed on anti-PD-1/L1 antibody as immediate prior therapy (including non\u2013anti-CTLA-4 antibody combinations) were eligible. Patients received pembrolizumab 200 mg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg once every 3 weeks for four doses, followed by pembrolizumab monotherapy. The primary end point was RR by irRECIST. After 35 patients, the trial met the primary end point and was expanded to enroll a total of 70 patients to better estimate the RR.\n\nRESULTS Prior treatments included 60 on anti-PD-1 antibody alone and 10 on anti-PD-1/L1 antibody\u2013based combinations. Thirteen patients had progressed in the adjuvant setting. The median length of prior treatment with anti-PD-1/L1 antibody was 4.8 months. Response assessments included five complete and 15 partial responses, making the irRECIST RR 29% among the entire trial population. The median progression-free survival was 5.0 months, and the median overall survival was 24.7 months. The median duration of response was 16.6 months. There was no difference in median time on prior anti-PD1/L1 or time to PD1 1 CTLA4 initiation between responders and nonresponders. Grade 3-4 drug-related adverse events occurred in 27% of patients. Responses occurred in PD-L1\u2013negative, non-T-cell\u2013inflamed, and intermediate tumor phenotypes.\n\nCONCLUSION To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study in melanoma of pembrolizumab plus low-dose ipilimumab after anti-PD-1/L1 immunotherapy failure, demonstrating significant antitumor activity and tolerability.\n\nJ Clin Oncol 39:2647-2655. \u00a9 2021 by American Society of Clinical Oncology\n\n# INTRODUCTION\n\nFor patients with advanced melanoma, the introduction of targeted and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies has greatly improved systemic therapy outcomes.[1](#page-7-0) With antibodies against the immune checkpoints cytotoxic T-lymphocyte\u2013associated antigen 4 (anti\u2013cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte-4 [CTLA-4]; ipilimumab) and programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1; pembrolizumab and nivolumab), some patients have achieved long-term disease control, with 5 year survival rates ranging from 34% to 52%.[2](#page-7-1),[3](#page-7-2) Combination immunotherapy using both anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies demonstrates a numerically higher response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) relative to anti-PD-1 antibody monotherapy, but with a grade 3-4 toxicity rate of up to 59%.[4](#page-7-3) This has prompted many treating oncologists to begin with single-agent anti-PD-1 therapy, with the prospect of using ipilimumab in the second line upon treatment failure.\n\nHowever, in patients who have experienced tumor progression on anti-PD-1 and programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody monotherapy, no prospective trials of ipilimumab or an anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4\n\nASSOCIATED CONTENT See accompanying editorial on page [2637](http://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JCO.21.00943) Appendix [Protocol](https://ascopubs.org/doi/suppl/10.1200/JCO.21.00079)\n\nAuthor affiliations and support information (if applicable) appear at the end of this article.

Grade 3-4 adverse events occurred in 27% of patients, and responses occurred primarily among PD-L1\u2013negative, non-T-cell\u2013inflamed, and intermediate tumor phenotypes.\n\n# Relevance\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first prospective study in melanoma of pembrolizumab plus low-dose ipilimumab after anti-PD-1/L1 immunotherapy failure, demonstrating significant antitumor activity and tolerability.\n\nantibody combination exist. Post hoc assessment of 97 patients who crossed over to ipilimumab directly after pembrolizumab in the randomized phase III KEYNOTE-006 trial demonstrated a 13% objective response rate (ORR)[.5](#page-7-4) Similarly, a retrospective review of treatment outcomes in 355 patients with progression on an anti-PD-1/L1 antibody demonstrated that those who subsequently received ipilimumab achieved an RR of 13% versus 32% in those who received ipilimumab of dose 3 mg/kg once every 3 weeks for four doses plus an anti-PD-1/L1 antibody. The OS also appeared to favor the combination group at 20.4 months versus 8.8 months, respectively.[6](#page-7-5) These findings support the hypothesis that combined PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibition can be effective after progression on a prior anti-PD-1/L1. The use of this combination in the second line might also theoretically spare the higher toxicity rate for patients who only required single-agent anti-PD-1 therapy for disease control.\n\nDespite demonstrating the highest ORR, PFS, and OS, the combination of nivolumab plus ipilimumab at 3 mg/kg treatment is not uniformly used in advanced melanoma because of serious immune-related adverse events.[4](#page-7-3) A strategy for mitigating toxicity with this combination immunotherapy is administration of low-dose ipilimumab, 1 mg/kg, in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody. The randomized Checkmate-511 study compared nivolumab with ipilimumab at 1 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg, demonstrating that high-grade adverse events (grades 3-5) occurred in 34% versus 48% of patients, respectively, whereas exploratory efficacy outcomes were similar.[7](#page-7-6) No prospective studies have yet described the utility of anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4 antibody therapy following progression on anti-PD-1/L1 monotherapy.\n\nMultiple biomarkers of anti-PD-1 treatment response, such as PD-L1 immunohistochemistry and gene expression profiling centered on interferon-associated transcripts, have been identified to stratify immunotherapy treatment outcomes. T-cell\u2013inflamed gene expression, which more broadly describes the tumor microenvironment than PD-L1 staining alone, perhaps has the strongest predictive association with response in melanoma.[8](#page-7-7) Immunotherapy biomarkers have been predominately explored in the treatment-na\u00a8\u0131ve setting, and it remains unclear what relationship these biomarkers have with response after failure on an anti-PD-1/L1 antibody.\n\nHerein, we report outcomes from a phase II clinical trial for the combination of pembrolizumab plus low-dose ipilimumab following progression on an anti-PD-1/L1 antibody in advanced melanoma. We also report baseline tumor biomarkers of clinical response to this combination immunotherapy regimen.\n\n# METHODS\n\n# Study Design and Participants\n\nIn this open-label, single-arm phase II trial, we recruited patients from seven medical centers across the United States. Eligible adult patients had unresectable or metastatic melanoma with known BRAF mutation status, uveal melanoma excluded, measurable disease according to immune-related RECIST (irRECIST) version 1.1,[9](#page-7-8) and adequate organ function and performance status. Patients with previous grade 3-4 toxicity from anti-PD-1/L1 antibody therapy leading to treatment discontinuation were excluded. All patients must have experienced disease progression during treatment with an anti-PD-1/L1 antibody immediately before accrual to this study or disease progression within 6 months of adjuvant anti-PD-1 antibody without intercurrent therapy. For patients without clear clinical progression on the prior anti-PD-1/L1 antibody, a confirmatory scan was recommended but not required. Patients with active CNS metastases were excluded (previously treated, stable CNS disease allowed); no prior anti-CTLA-4 antibody use in the metastatic setting was permitted. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in the study Protocol (online only [pp 12-15]). The study Protocol was reviewed and approved by the appropriate institutional review boards at each participating site. We conducted the study in accordance with the Protocol with subsequent amendments and with the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent.\n\n# Procedures\n\nPatients received pembrolizumab (200 mg) intravenously along with low-dose ipilimumab (1 mg/kg) intravenously once every 3 weeks for four doses, followed by pembrolizumab intravenously 200 mg once every 3 weeks for up to 2 years. Treatment continued until confirmed radiographic disease progression, intolerable toxicity, patient withdrawal of consent, investigator decision, or completion of therapy. Per irRECIST, patients with initial evidence of radiographic progression were allowed to continue through to a second confirmatory scan to account for tumor flare; however, patients with evidence of clinical deterioration or clear objective disease progression, as assessed by the treating physician, were not required to have repeat imaging for confirmation of progressive disease. Study treatments continued for up to 2 years, although patients who attained a complete response confirmed on at least two scans after a minimum of 24 weeks of study treatment could discontinue treatment early. Full discontinuation criteria are included in the study Protocol (pp 25-26). No dose reductions of pembrolizumab or ipilimumab were permitted.\n\nImmunohistochemistry for tumor PD-L1 expression and gene expression profiling were performed on archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE). Full methods for PD-L1 scoring, as well as procedures for RNA extraction and gene expression profiling by RNAseq, are included in the [Appendix](#page-10-0) (online only).\n\nFormal clinical assessments of response were completed per irRECIST version 1.1 before initiation of study therapy and every 12 weeks thereafter, with intervals of at least every 3 weeks required for confirmation of disease progression. At all treatment and follow-up visits, we assessed physical examination status, vital signs, and laboratory values. Adverse events were documented according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0.\n\n# Outcome Analysis\n\nThe primary objective of this study was to determine the ORR of pembrolizumab with low-dose ipilimumab following initial progression on an anti-PD-1/L1 antibody in advanced melanoma. Secondary objectives included summarizing PFS (defined as time on study treatment until immunerelated progressive disease, clear clinical progression, or death) and safety. Exploratory objectives included associations of baseline tumor gene expression patterns with clinical outcomes. Although not prespecified end points in the study Protocol, OS (defined as the time from enrollment to death from any cause) and duration of response (DOR; defined as the time from first evidence of response until disease progression or death) were also assessed.\n\n# Statistical Analysis\n\nThe initial design of this study sought to test a null hypothesis of a 10% RR (based on known historical controls for ipilimumab) versus a 30% alternative.[5](#page-7-4) Simon's optimal two-stage design was initially employed to enroll up to a total of 35 patients. In the first stage, 12 patients were enrolled with two responses required to initiate the second stage, where a total of 35 patients would be enrolled (one-sided alpha .10, 90% power). Given the investigator-initiated and open-label nature of the study, no formal accrual hold was planned for interim analysis. It was observed that two patients responded within the first five patients accrued and there were seven responders in the first 12 patients of the Simon design. The primary end point for the total study was met when eight responses were observed in the first 17 patients, after which the trial was expanded to enroll a total of 70 patients in an exploratory manner to better describe the ORR in this population.[10](#page-7-9) We assessed ORR and, using the Kaplan-Meier method, estimated PFS and OS in all enrolled patients as well as DOR in patients achieving a partial or complete response. We provided descriptive statistics for baseline patient characteristics and for adverse events. Frequency of adverse events for each grade level was recorded among all patients receiving at least one dose of study therapy.\n\nAvailable tumor specimens were analyzed for PD-L1 expression and gene expression profiling; these biomarkers were then compared with clinical response outcomes. We used a previously described T-cell inflammation score,[11](#page-7-10) which correlates with other validated interferon-g gene signatures [\\(Appendix\\)](#page-10-0).[12](#page-7-11) This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: [NCT02743819.](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02743819) The trial is closed to enrollment, but patients remain on treatment and in observation for safety and ongoing response assessments.\n\n# RESULTS\n\nFrom December 9, 2016 to November 4, 2019, 70 patients were enrolled and treated with at least one dose of pembrolizumab plus low-dose ipilimumab. Before enrollment, the median time on prior anti-PD-1/L1 antibody was 4.8 months (Appendix [Fig A1,](#page-10-1) online only). Thirteen study patients (19%) progressed previously in the adjuvant setting. Two patients received adjuvant ipilimumab and completed this treatment 15 and 22 months before receiving an anti-PD-1/L1 antibody. Progression to prior anti-PD-1/L1 therapy was determined by confirmatory scans in 55 (79%) patients and by assessment of clinical progression by the treating physician in 15 (21%) patients.

At the time of the analysis, five patients (7%) were continuing to receive pembrolizumab monotherapy and one patient had completed 2 years of study therapy. All other patients have discontinued because of clinical or radiographic disease progression in 47 patients (67%), adverse events in nine patients (13%), elective discontinuation of therapy after complete response in four patients (6%), death unrelated to study therapy in two patients (3%), or withdrawal of consent in two patients (3%). Fifty-three patients (76%) received four or more doses of pembrolizumab plus lowdose ipilimumab. Of those who did not complete four cycles of study therapy, the median number of cycles was 2 (IQR, 1.75-2.25) and reasons for discontinuation among these patients were progressive disease (n 5 11), adverse events (n 5 4), and death (n 5 2). For patients continuing pembrolizumab monotherapy, the median number of cycles was 9 (IQR, 5.0-15.8).\n\nTwenty of 70 enrolled patients (29%) achieved a confirmed response (95% CI, 18.4 to 40.6), including five complete (7.2%) and 15 partial responses (21.4%) [\\(Fig 1\\)](#page-4-0). Three additional patients had unconfirmed responses, all with subsequent disease progression. Eight patients were nonevaluable for radiographic assessment of the primary end point but are included in the overall analysis for ORR (as nonresponders) and secondary end points. Of the eight nonevaluable patients, five had clear clinical progression before first response assessment, two patients died of complications related to disease progression before restaging, and one patient withdrew consent after experiencing grade three immune-related hepatitis after one dose of study therapy. The median PFS was 5 months (95% CI, 2.8 to 8.3). In responding patients, the median DOR was 16.6 months (95% CI, 7.9 to not reached). The median OS was 24.7 months (95% CI, 15.2 to not reached) (Appendix [Fig A2](#page-11-0), online only). At the time of data lock, 14 of 20 responses (70%) were ongoing.\n\nResponses were observed across clinical and biomarker subgroups ([Table 2](#page-5-0)), including patients who progressed on an anti-PD-1/L1 antibody in the adjuvant setting (two of 13 [15%]), patients with liver metastases and previously treated CNS metastases (six of 25 [17%]), and patients with an elevated LDH at study entry (six of 22 [27%]). No association between time on prior anti-PD-1/L1 antibody therapy and subsequent response to study therapy was observed. The median time between prior anti-PD-1/L1 treatments and initiating pembrolizumab plus low-dose ipilimumab was 1.5 months in responders vs 1.4 months in nonresponders. More responses were observed in PD-L1\u2013negative archival tumors (15 of 39 [38%]) as compared with PD-L1\u2013positive archival tumors (four of 27 [15%]). T-cell\u2013inflamed gene expression scores were calculated across all patients with archival tissue adequate for RNA extraction (n 5 58). Two T-cell\u2013inflamed tumors were observed among the 20 responders, with the remainder being either non-T-cell\u2013inflamed or intermediate ([Table 3\\)](#page-5-1).\n\nTreatment-related adverse events occurred in 62 of 70 patients (87%), with the most frequent events being pruritis, rash, diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, and transaminase elevations [\\(Table 4\\)](#page-6-0). Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 19 of 70 patients (27%), with the most common being colitis or diarrhea, rash, and transaminase elevations. Only one patient experienced a grade four treatment-related adverse event, which was a concurrent lipase elevation in a patient with grade three pancreatitis.\n\n![](_page_4_Figure_3.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-4-0\"></span>FIG 1.

Responses were observed in 29% of all study patients. Responses are ongoing in 70% of responding patients, with a median response duration of 16.6 months. Responses were also observed across all clinical subgroups, including patients with elevated LDH and brain and liver metastases and in patients who progressed on an anti-PD-1/L1 antibody in the adjuvant setting. Most responses were observed among patients who progressed on a prior anti-PD-1/L1 antibody within 6 months, although responses were also observed among those with longer prior treatment. Additionally, these responses occurred predominantly among patients with intermediate to non-T-cell\u2013inflamed and PD-L1\u2013negative tumors. The study regimen showed a relatively low rate of toxicity, with grade 3-4 adverse events occurring in 27% of all study patients.\n\nProlonged response, even after cessation of therapy, is a hallmark feature of immune checkpoint inhibitors.[3](#page-7-2)[,13](#page-7-12) The durable responses observed with pembrolizumab plus lowdose ipilimumab suggest that this benefit may carry forward when using an anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4 antibody combination after anti-PD-1 antibody failure. These findings may be particularly informative for future drug development after failure of an anti-PD-1/L1 antibody by setting an important benchmark for therapies in this space.\n\nAlthough high rates of toxicity have previously limited safe delivery of anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4 combinations, the 27% grade 3-4 adverse event rate observed with pembrolizumab plus low-dose ipilimumab reflects a comparatively manageable side effect profile. Currently, there is no prospective comparison of toxicity for anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibody combinations in the anti-PD-1/L1 antibody\u2013refractory setting, although high-grade toxicity rates in the anti-PD-1/L1 antibody\u2013na\u00a8\u0131ve setting surpass 50%[.4](#page-7-3) In this study, we used a 1 mg/kg dose of ipilimumab to mitigate such high rates of toxicity, while seeking to maintain antitumor activity, as this strategy has shown promise in the anti-PD-1/L1\u2013na\u00a8\u0131ve setting.[7](#page-7-6),[14](#page-7-13) The 1 mg/kg ipilimumab dose may, to an extent, explain the relatively favorable rates of toxicity observed with pembrolizumab plus low-dose ipilimumab. We would, however, make only cautious comparisons between toxicity rates between the anti-PD-1/L1 antibody\u2013refractory and antibody\u2013na\u00a8\u0131ve settings. As anti-PD-1/L1 antibody refractory patients who experienced high-grade toxicity were ineligible for our study, toxicity rates observed with ipilimumab combination in the anti-PD-1/L1 antibody\u2013refractory setting may be subject to this selection bias.\n\nResponses to pembrolizumab plus low-dose ipilimumab were observed predominantly among PD-L1\u2013negative and intermediate to non-T-cell\u2013inflamed tumors. This is contrary to what has been observed in the anti-PD-1/L1 antibody\u2013na\u00a8\u0131ve setting, where biomarkers of T-cell inflammation and PD-L1 expression enrich for response[.8](#page-7-7)[,15,](#page-7-14)[16](#page-8-0) Previously, MHC class II expression has been shown to predict\n\n<span id=\"page-6-0\"></span>TABLE 4.

This could explain in part why patients who benefited from pembrolizumab plus low-dose ipilimumab were found to have non-T-cell\u2013inflamed tumor phenotypes. It remains unclear, however, how the addition of ipilimumab drives antitumor responses after a failure of an anti-PD-1/L1 antibody. One possibility is that ipilimumab may enhance the development of de novo antitumor responses in the peripheral immune compartment and/or relieve independent mechanisms of resistance associated with PD-1/L1 expression in the tumor microenvironment. These hypotheses are supported by neoadjuvant ipilimumab studies in which an influx of CD8<sup>1</sup> T cells into the tumor microenvironment was observed after treatment[.20](#page-8-3) The exact immunologic mechanisms by which ipilimumab may facilitate these antitumor responses require further investigation.\n\nWe recognize that our study has certain limitations. Given the constraints of an uncontrolled study, we would await the randomized results of anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4 antibody combination after anti-PD-1 antibody failure to definitively make a claim of superiority for the combination regimen[.21](#page-8-4) Additionally, at the time this study began, there was not a formal consensus to define progression on an anti-PD-1/L1 antibody as it exists currently.[22](#page-8-5) In reviewing our study, 79% of patients had two scans to confirm progression on a prior anti-PD-1/L1 antibody, and for patients without confirmatory scans, treating physicians used their clinical judgment to ascertain a lack of benefit from the prior anti-PD-1/L1 antibody. Although RECIST 1.1 remains a predominant treatment response method, we chose irRECIST to more completely describe the clinical outcomes as the primary end point analysis for an immunotherapy trial. Regarding our observations surrounding lack of a T-cell\u2013inflamed tumor phenotype with response, these findings are predicated on baseline, archival FFPE tumor samples. Future studies incorporating pre- and on-treatment biopsies after anti-PD-1/L1 antibody failure will be helpful to fully characterize mechanisms of tumor microenvironment modulation by ipilimumab. We also recognize that in clinical practice, some patients may receive intercurrent BRAF-/ MEK-directed therapy after progression on an anti-PD-1/L1 antibody. Outcomes for this specific subgroup await further study.\n\nThe combination of pembrolizumab plus low-dose ipilimumab demonstrated significant antitumor activity and tolerability in a multicenter clinical trial. This study demonstrated long-term responses, suggesting that durable survival\u2014a hallmark of immunotherapy activity\u2014may be possible even after failure of an anti-PD-1/L1 antibody. These findings warrant further investigation and support the ongoing effort to directly compare combination of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies with ipilimumab alone in the anti-PD-1/L1 antibody\u2013refractory setting.\n\n# AFFILIATIONS\n\n1 University of Chicago Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chicago, IL 2 H.

The Cell Signaling Technology EIL3N programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) monoclonal antibody was used for PD-L1 scoring. This antibody has been previously validated for PD-L1 scoring and showed high concordance with commercially available PD-L1 antibodies, including DAKO 22C35.[23](#page-8-6) Tumor cells were scored by University of Chicago pathologists using the DAKO 22C3 method as taught in the interactive primer course on the DAKO 22C3 website; this method is employed as standard practice for PD-L1 scoring at the University of Chicago. A cutoff of \\$ 1% was used to define PD-L1 positivity as consistent with the melanoma KEYNOTE trials.\n\nRNA sequencing and gene expression profiling. Tumor RNA was isolated from available formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples using the QIAGEN AllPrep DNA/RNA FFPE kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) at the Human Immunologic Monitoring Facility at the University of Chicago according to the manufacturer's instruction. The quality and quantity of RNA were measured on an Agilent 2100 Bio-analyzer using Agilent reagents and protocols (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). RNAseq libraries were generated using Illumina TruSEQ Total RNA stranded library\u2013making kits using Illumina protocols (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The quality and quantity of the library were determined using an Agilent 2100 Bio-analyzer using Agilent reagents and protocols. Sequencing data were collected using an Illumina NovaSEQ sequencer and demultiplexed using Illumina bcl2fastq software. The quality of raw reads was assessed by FastQC[.24](#page-8-7) Reads were aligned to human reference transcriptome with Gencode gene annotation (GRCh38) by Kallisto.[25](#page-8-8) Transcript abundance was quantified at the transcript level using the strand-specific protocol, summarized into gene level using tximport[,26](#page-8-9) normalized by the trimmed mean of M values (TMM) method, and log2-transformed for further analysis. T-cell\u2013inflamed gene expression scores were determined using a 160-gene signature of T-cell inflammation[,11](#page-7-10) and the expression for each gene was normalized to its mean expression level by subtracting the average value and dividing by the standard deviation, such that the average value of the normalized data was 0 and the standard deviation was 1. T-cell\u2013inflamed gene expression scores were calculated by taking the median of the normalized values for each gene in the signature. Of the 58 tumor specimens with RNA adequate for analysis, 50 were obtained before initial anti-PD-1/L1 antibody treatment and eight were obtained after anti-PD-1/L1 antibody treatment, but before initiating study treatment with pembrolizumab plus low-dose ipilimumab.\n\n![](_page_10_Figure_6.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-10-1\"></span>FIG A1.

To our knowledge, this was the first randomized trial to evaluate addition of an oncolytic virus to a checkpoint inhibitor.\n\n# Methods\n\nPatients with unresectable stages IIIB to IV melanoma, with no more than one prior therapy if BRAF wild-type, no more than two prior therapies if BRAF mutant, measurable/injectable disease, and without symptomatic autoimmunity or clinically significant immunosuppression were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive talimogene laherparepvec plus ipilimumab or ipilimumab alone. Talimogene laherparepvec treatment began in week 1 (first dose, # 4 mL 3 106 plaque-forming units/mL; after 3 weeks, # 4 mL 3 108 plaque-forming units/mL every 2 weeks). Ipilimumab (3 mg/kg every 3 weeks; up to four doses) began week 1 in the ipilimumab alone arm and week 6 in the combination arm. The primary end point was objective response rate evaluated by investigators per immunerelated response criteria.\n\n# Results\n\nOne hundred ninety-eight patients were randomly assigned to talimogene laherparepvec plus ipilimumab (n = 98), or ipilimumab alone (n = 100). Thirty-eight patients (39%) in the combination arm and 18 patients (18%) in the ipilimumab arm had an objective response (odds ratio, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.5 to 5.5; P = .002). Responses were not limited to injected lesions; visceral lesion decreases were observed in 52% of patients in the combination arm and 23% of patients in the ipilimumab arm. Frequently occurring adverse events (AEs) included fatigue (combination, 59%; ipilimumab alone, 42%), chills (combination, 53%; ipilimumab alone, 3%), and diarrhea (combination, 42%; ipilimumab alone, 35%). Incidence of grade \\$ 3 AEs was 45% and 35%, respectively. Three patients in the combination arm had fatal AEs; none were treatment related.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe study met its primary end point; the objective response rate was significantly higher with talimogene laherparepvec plus ipilimumab versus ipilimumab alone. These data indicate that the combination has greater antitumor activity without additional safety concerns versus ipilimumab.\n\nJ Clin Oncol 36:1658-1667. \u00a9 2017 by American Society of Clinical Oncology\n\nAppendix DOI: [https://doi.org/10.1200/JCO.](http://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JCO.2017.73.7379) [2017.73.7379](http://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JCO.2017.73.7379)\n\n![](_page_0_Picture_22.jpeg)\n\nDOI: [https://doi.org/10.1200/JCO.2017.](http://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JCO.2017.73.7379) [73.7379](http://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JCO.2017.73.7379)\n\n#### INTRODUCTION\n\nNew therapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and oncolytic viruses, have transformed patient care in advanced melanoma. Potentially, combination therapy strategies targeting complementary cancer immunity pathways could improve antitumor responses versus single-agent therapy[.1](#page-9-0) Consistent with this hypothesis, combination therapy with ipilimumab plus nivolumab improved response rates in untreated metastatic melanoma versus ipilimumab monotherapy, albeit with increased toxicity.[2,3](#page-9-0) These results advocate for evaluation of novel combinations with lower toxicity.\n\nIpilimumab is an anti\u2013cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) antibody[.4](#page-9-0) In previously treated advanced melanoma, ipilimumab improved overall response versus gp100 (10.9% v 1.5%; P , .001; complete response [CR], 1.5% v 0%)[.5](#page-9-0) In treatment-naive advanced melanoma, ipilimumab treatment resulted in an objective response rate (ORR) of 19.0% (CR, 2.2%) and median time to objective response of 2.8 months (range, 2.5 to 12.4 months).[2](#page-9-0) Improvement in overall survival (OS) with ipilimumab monotherapy relative to gp100[5](#page-9-0) and in combination with dacarbazine versus dacarbazine alone has been reported.[6](#page-9-0) Talimogene laherparepvec is a genetically modified herpes simplex virus type 1 that expresses the immunostimulatory cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulating factor.[7](#page-9-0) In the phase III single-agent registration study OPTiM talimogene laherparepvec improved durable response rate (primary end point) versus subcutaneous granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (16% v 2%; P , .001).[8](#page-9-0)\n\nTalimogene laherparepvec and ipilimumab enhance T-cell activation through different mechanisms. Talimogene laherparepvec is designed to increase tumor-specific immune activation by improving antigen presentation and T-cell priming,[9](#page-9-0) whereas CTLA-4 blockade with ipilimumab promotes T-cell expansion.[10](#page-9-0) Combining these therapies may enhance antitumor immune responses, and thereby provide greater antitumor activity than either agent alone. Specifically, we hypothesized that ipilimumab would augment systemic antitumor responses triggered by talimogene laherparepvec, yielding improved outcomes.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, we evaluated talimogene laherparepvec in combination with ipilimumab in patients with unresected advanced melanoma in a phase Ib/II study. Phase Ib results have been reported previously.[11](#page-9-0) Herein, we report the primary analysis of the randomized phase II portion, which compared talimogene laherparepvec plus ipilimumab with ipilimumab alone in patients with stages IIIB to IV melanoma.\n\n# METHODS\n\n# Patients\n\nEligible patients (\\$ 18 years of age) had histologically confirmed stages IIIB to IVM1c malignant melanoma not suitable for surgical resection, but suitable for injection (\\$ 1 cutaneous/subcutaneous/nodal lesion \\$ 5 mm in longest diameter); measurable disease per contrastenhanced or spiral computed tomography (CT; visceral lesions) or calipers (cutaneous/subcutaneous lesions); Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status # 1; and adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function. Patients were initially required to be treatment naive; however, a protocol amendment that was intended to account for the availability of new melanoma therapies allowed the enrollment of patients who had received one line of systemic anticancer therapy if BRAF wild-type or # 2 lines if BRAF mutant (one must have been a BRAF inhibitor). Patients with primary uveal or mucosal melanoma, history of melanoma in an immunodeficient state, clinically active cerebral metastases, active herpetic lesions that require systemic treatment with antiherpetic drugs, evidence of clinically significant immunosuppression, history of inflammatory bowel disease and/or other symptomatic autoimmune disease, or prior exposure to talimogene laherparepvec and/or other oncolytic immunotherapy were excluded. Prior ipilimumab therapy was permitted if patients had previously had a partial response (PR), CR, or stable disease for \\$ 6 months. Prior anti\u2013programmed death-1 or anti\u2013CTLA-4 antibody therapy was permitted if discontinuation did not result from treatment-related adverse events (AEs).\n\nPatients provided written informed consent. Institutional review boards/ethics committees at each site approved study procedures.\n\n#### Study Design\n\nThe phase II part of the study was an open-label, multicenter, randomized trial evaluating talimogene laherparepvec in combination with ipilimumab (Appendix [Fig A1,](#page-11-0) online only). Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive talimogene laherparepvec plus ipilimumab or ipilimumab alone. Before the protocol amendment, random assignment was stratified by disease stage (IIIB/IIIC/IVM1a/IVM1b v IVM1c) and BRAFV600E status (mutant v wild-type); after the amendment, random assignment was stratified by disease stage (stage IIIB/IIIC/IVM1a v IVM1b/ IVM1c) and prior therapy (treatment naive v previous systemic anticancer immunotherapy v systemic anticancer treatment other than immunotherapy) to better distinguish between patients whose disease had or had not spread beyond the skin and/or lymph nodes.\n\nIn the combination arm, talimogene laherparepvec was injected intralesionally on day 1 of week 1 at a dose of 106 plaque-forming units/mL (# 4.0 mL total injection volume; new and larger lesions were prioritized) followed by administration on day 1 of week 4, and every 2 weeks thereafter at 108 plaque-forming units/mL (# 4.0 mL)[12;](#page-9-0) ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) was administered intravenously every 3 weeks beginning on day 1 of week 6 for up to four infusions. Talimogene laherparepvec acts in the earliest stages of the cancer immunity cycle by initiating antigen release/presentation.[9](#page-9-0),[13](#page-9-0) Ipilimumab was initiated after two doses of talimogene laherparepvec to potentially maximize the agents' complementary mechanisms of action. In the ipilimumab arm, ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) was administered intravenously every 3 weeks beginning on day 1 of week 1 for up to four infusions. Talimogene laherparepvec treatment continued until CR, all injectable tumors had disappeared, confirmed disease progression per modified immune-related response criteria (irRC),[14](#page-9-0) or intolerance. Ipilimumab treatment continued for four infusions, until disease progression per irRC or unacceptable ipilimumab-related toxicity. Talimogene laherparepvec dose reductions were not permitted, other than a reduction in injection volume as a result of a reduction in lesion dimensions. Treatment could be delayed and/or withheld as a result of toxicity; delays . 4 weeks as a result of AEs resulted in permanent discontinuation. Ipilimumab dose reductions were not permitted; dosing could be withheld and/or discontinued as a result of toxicity. If talimogene laherparepvec was delayed and/or discontinued, ipilimumab treatment could continue. The study protocol includes complete dose modification rules.\n\n#### End Points\n\nThe primary end point was investigator-assessed ORR per modified irRC (Study Protocol).[14](#page-9-0) Secondary end points included OS, best overall response, disease control rate, time to response, duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS), and safety.\n\n#### Assessments\n\nRadiographic imaging was done at baseline, every 12 weeks thereafter (independent of treatment cycle) until clinically relevant disease progression, and at the safety follow-up. Tumor assessments included measurement of cutaneous/subcutaneous/nodal lesions by calipers. Radiographic assessments of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were performed by CT, positron emission tomography/CT, or magnetic resonance imaging. Response assessments were per irR[C14](#page-9-0) and required response/disease progression to be confirmed by a second consecutive clinical/radiographic assessment \\$ 4 weeks after the first documented response/disease progression. Confirmation of disease progression was only required in the absence of rapid clinical deterioration. AEs occurring during the study were recorded and graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0.\n\n#### Statistical Analysis\n\nThe planned sample size of approximately 200 patients was estimated to provide 90% power to detect a significant difference in investigatorassessed ORR with an overall two-sided 5% significance level for testing the null hypothesis of no treatment effect, assuming a range of potential ORRs <span id=\"page-2-0\"></span>in the ipilimumab arm. Assuming an ORR for ipilimumab of 15.0%, 90% power was achieved if the ORR in the combination arm was at least 35.7%. The intent-to-treat analysis set included all randomly assigned patients analyzed according to the treatment to which they were randomly assigned. The safety analysis set included all patients who received \\$ 1 dose of talimogene laherparepvec or ipilimumab, analyzed according to the treatment received. The between-arm treatment comparison in ORR was evaluated using a x<sup>2</sup> test with continuity correction with a two-sided 5% significance level.[15](#page-9-0) Exact binomial two-sided 95% CIs were calculated for each arm for ORR and disease control rate.[16](#page-9-0) Logistic regression was used to evaluate treatment effect adjusted for covariates. An unstratified log-rank test was used to compare PFS (defined as time from random assignment to the earlier of disease progression or death), time to response, and duration of response between arms. Treatment effects on PFS, time to response, and duration of response were estimated using unstratified Cox proportional hazards models; P values for these end points were descriptive. The primary analysis of OS (using an unstratified log-rank test; two-sided a = 0.05 conditional on a statistically significant ORR increase) was planned for approximately 3 years after the last patient was randomly assigned.\n\n### RESULTS\n\n# Patients\n\nBetween August 2013 and February 2016, 198 patients from 45 sites in the United States, France, and Germany were randomly assigned to talimogene laherparepvec plus ipilimumab (n = 98), or ipilimumab (n = 100). At the time of the primary analysis (August 23, 2016), five patients were continuing to receive talimogene\n\n![](_page_2_Figure_6.jpeg)\n\nFig 1. Disposition of patients in the study. (\\*) Of the 76 patients who were not randomly assigned, 57 did not meet eligibility criteria. (\u2020) Ninety-one patients in the talimogene laherparepvec plus ipilimumab arm received at least one dose of both study treatments. (\u2021) Eight patients were enrolled in the study but did not receive any study medication: talimogene laherparepvec plus ipilimumab (n = 3); ipilimumab alone (n = 5). All but one patient withdrew consent before treatment began; the remaining patient withdrew for insurance reasons. All were included in the intentto-treat analysis of efficacy.\n\nlaherparepvec and three patients (all in the combination arm) were continuing to receive ipilimumab ([Fig 1\\)](#page-2-0). Baseline characteristics were generally balanced between arms (Table 1).\n\n# Exposure\n\nThe median duration of talimogene laherparepvec treatment was 21.1 weeks; the median duration of ipilimumab treatment was 9.1 weeks in both arms. The median number of talimogene laherparepvec doses was 10 (range, 1 to 45 doses). Of the 95 patients in each arm who received treatment, 63 patients in the combination arm and 66 patients in the ipilimumab arm received four ipilimumab doses. The mean (6 standard deviation) number of ipilimumab doses administered was 3.3 (6 1.1) in the combination arm and 3.5 (6 0.9) in the ipilimumab arm. At the time of analysis, 29% of patients in the combination arm and 27% of patients in the ipilimumab arm were being followed for tumor response. The median follow-up time was 68 weeks (range, 0 to 156 weeks) in the combination arm and 58 weeks (range, 0 to 152 weeks) in the ipilimumab arm.\n\n# Response Rate\n\nThe ORR was significantly improved in the combination arm versus the ipilimumab arm. Among randomly assigned patients, 38 patients (39% [CR, 13%; PR, 26%]) in the combination arm and 18 patients (18% [CR, 7%; PR, 11%]) in the ipilimumab arm had an objective response (see footnote in [Table 2](#page-4-0)). Some patients were unevaluable for response ([Table 2\\)](#page-4-0). The between-arm difference in ORR was 20.8% (odds ratio [OR], 2.9; 95% CI, 1.5 to 5.5; x<sup>2</sup> , P = .002). Seven patients in the combination arm and one patient in the ipilimumab arm had disease progression per irRC before response.\n\nThe ORR for patients with stage IIIB/IIIC/IVM1a disease was 44% in the combination arm and 19% in the ipilimumab arm (OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.4 to 7.8; P = .007); for patients with stage IVM1b/IVM1c disease, the ORR was 33% and 16%, respectively (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 0.9 to 7.0; P = .09; [Fig 2A\\)](#page-5-0). Among BRAF wildtype patients, the ORR was 42% (26 of 62 patients) in the combination arm versus 10% (six of 60 patients) in the ipilimumab arm (OR, 6.5; 95% CI, 2.4 to 17.4; P , .001). Among patients with BRAF-mutant tumors, the ORR was 34% (12 of 35 patients) in the combination arm versus 32% (11 of 34 patients) in the ipilimumab arm (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.4 to 3.0; P = 1.0; [Fig](#page-5-0) [2A\\)](#page-5-0). The estimated OR for treatment effect in a stepwise logistic regression model was 2.73 (P = .004; Appendix [Table A1](#page-11-0), online only).\n\nThe median time to response was 5.8 months (95% CI, 5.4 to 10.9 months) in the combination arm (n = 38) and not estimable (95% CI, not estimable) in the ipilimumab arm (n = 18; HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 0.8 to 2.5; [Table 2](#page-4-0)). The median duration of response was not reached in either arm [\\(Table 2](#page-4-0)). At the time of analysis, 89% of patients in the combination arm and 83% of patients in the ipilimumab arm with a response remained in response.

Data presented as number (%) unless otherwise specified.\n\nAbbreviation: NE, not estimable.\n\n\\*Initial complete response, partial response, and progressive disease assessment was confirmed by subsequent assessment \\$ 4 weeks apart. A complete response or partial response without confirmation was classified as stable disease. There was no confirmation for unevaluable or stable disease; however, stable disease duration must have been . 77 days.\n\n\u2020Patients could be classified as unevaluable if (1) they had a single unconfirmed evaluation of progressive disease at the last assessment before data cutoff, (2) all postbaseline response assessments were classified as unevaluable, or (3) patients were evaluated as having stable disease with no subsequent tumor evaluation after 77 days from randomization. The highest incidence of assessment of unevaluable was because of unconfirmed progressive disease: combination arm (n = 2), ipilimumab arm (n = 10); the remaining patients had stable disease before 77 days from random assignment: combination arm (n = 1), ipilimumab arm (n = 3); had all postbaseline assessments classified as unevaluable: combination arm ( n = 1), ipilimumab arm (n = 3), or were in the study awaiting potential confirmation of progressive disease: ipilimumab arm (n = 1).\n\n\u2021Radiographic imaging or clinical measurement of index lesions was not performed at any postbaseline time point. The highest incidence of assessment of \"not done\" was because of patients not receiving study treatment: combination arm (n = 3), ipilimumab arm (n = 5). Imaging was also not done for patients who had early end of treatment or end of response before the first scheduled assessment: combination arm (n = 3), ipilimumab arm (n = 3).\n\n\u00a7P value is descriptive. kThe median time to response in the ipilimumab alone arm could not be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier technique.\n\n\u00b6Plus sign indicates response is ongoing.\n\n22 patients in the ipilimumab arm with evaluable visceral metastasis disease burdens, 16 (52%) and 5 (23%), respectively, had a decrease in visceral lesion burden [\\(Fig 3D](#page-6-0)).\n\n# Progression-Free Survival\n\nPFS analysis was descriptive [\\(Fig 4](#page-7-0)). Fifty-two of 98 patients (53%) in the combination arm and 51 of 100 patients (51%) in the ipilimumab arm had PFS events. The median PFS was 8.2 months (95% CI, 4.2 to 21.5 months) in the combination arm and 6.4 months (95% CI, 3.2 to 16.5 months) in the ipilimumab arm (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.23; P = .35). PFS was defined as time from random assignment to the earlier of disease progression or death; consequently, patients in the combination arm initiated ipilimumab therapy 5 weeks later than patients in the ipilimumab arm and had received only two ipilimumab doses at the first response assessment (12 weeks). At data cutoff, 20 of 98 patients (20%) in the combination arm and 23 of 100 patients (23%) in the ipilimumab arm had died. The HR for OS was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.44 to 1.46).\n\n# Safety\n\nNinety-three patients (98%) in the combination arm and 90 patients (95%) in the ipilimumab arm had \\$ 1 AE ([Table 3](#page-8-0)). Incidences of grade \\$ 3 AEs were 45% and 35%, respectively. The most frequently occurring AEs and events with greatest betweenarm differences in incidence were similar to those seen in other talimogene laherparepvec[8](#page-9-0) and ipilimumab studies[2](#page-9-0),[5](#page-9-0) and included fatigue (59%, 42%), chills (53%, 3%), diarrhea (42%, 35%), pruritus (40%, 36%), rash (39%, 28%), and nausea (38%, 24%, respectively; [Table 3\\)](#page-8-0). The incidence of grade \\$ 3 ipilimumab-related AEs was 19% in the combination arm and 18% in the ipilimumab arm; the most frequently occurring were GI disorders (colitis: 5%, 4%; diarrhea: 3%, 3%; autoimmune colitis: 2%, 3%, respectively).

Kaplan-Meier estimate of progressionfree survival (PFS). (\\*) P value is descriptive.\n\nAEs was 15%; the most frequently occurring were influenza-like illness (4%) and lymphopenia (4%). Two patients (2%) in the combination arm discontinued talimogene laherparepvec as a result of AEs; 12 patients (13%) in the combination arm and 16 patients (17%) in the ipilimumab arm discontinued ipilimumab as a result of AEs. Three patients in the combination arm had fatal AEs (myocardial infarction [n = 1], and disease progression [n = 2]); none were considered treatment related.\n\n#### DISCUSSION\n\nThis study, which to our knowledge is the first to evaluate an oncolytic virus in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor, met its primary end point: talimogene laherparepvec plus ipilimumab resulted in a significantly higher ORR versus ipilimumab alone (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.5 to 5.5; P = .002). Responses occurred in patients with and without visceral disease and in uninjected lesions after combination treatment. The confirmed ORR (39%) in the combination arm is higher than historical controls of either agent administered as monotherapy (ipilimumab, 11% to 19%[2](#page-9-0),[5](#page-9-0),[17,18](#page-9-0); talimogene laherparepvec, 26%[8](#page-9-0) ). In OPTiM, talimogene laherparepvec monotherapy was associated with a \\$ 50% size decrease in 64% of injected lesions and 15% of visceral lesions,[19](#page-9-0) suggesting that additional responses might be achievable through the addition of T-cell checkpoint inhibition. In the previously reported phase Ib portion, we observed changes in T-cell subsets consistent with this hypothesis,[11](#page-9-0) and, in this phase II portion, we found evidence of enhanced systemic antitumor response. Individual lesion-type analysis indicated that responses occurred in both injected and uninjected tumor burden. The higher rate of decrease (combination arm, 52%; ipilimumab arm, 23%) and higher rate of complete reduction in visceral tumor burden (combination arm, 23%; ipilimumab arm, 0%) is consistent with a systemic effect of the combination because talimogene laherparepvec was not injected into these lesions. The nonvisceral uninjected lesion tumor burden response was similar across arms. However, the number of patients in this category in the combination arm was smaller than in the control arm because patients with injected nonvisceral lesions were excluded. These results indicate that the combination elicited a greater systemic antitumor response than could be achieved with either agent alone.\n\nResponse rate favored the combination arm for both diseasestage subsets (IIIB/IIIC/IVM1a, 44% v 19%; IVM1b/IVM1c, 33% v 16%). Although response rates were high in patients with both BRAF wild-type and BRAF-mutant tumors, the effect size favoring combination treatment was greater in the BRAF wild-type subgroup (42% v 10%). The response rate was also greater in the combination arm for patients with BRAF wild-type versus BRAFmutant tumors (42% v 34%). Although small patient numbers in these subgroups may have contributed to this finding, similar results were observed in a previous phase III study of ipilimumab plus nivolumab.[3](#page-9-0) Treatment effect differences between BRAFmutant and BRAF wild-type subgroups might reflect differences in biologic response to the combination; however, we cannot exclude the possibility that they were driven by other patient and/or tumor characteristics.\n\nDespite ipilimumab treatment starting 5 weeks later in the combination arm, PFS was 8.2 months in the combination arm versus 6.4 months in the ipilimumab arm (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.23). The median PFS in the combination arm was also greater than that previously observed in ipilimumab monotherapy studies (2.8 to 2.9 months)[5,17,18](#page-9-0) and similar to the median time to treatment failure in the OPTiM study (8.2 months).[8](#page-9-0) The analysis of OS was immature; patients are still being followed for response and OS.\n\nToxicity observed with the combination was consistent with expectations from the phase Ib study.[11](#page-9-0) The incidence of grade \\$ 3 ipilimumab-related toxicities was similar between arms; no unexpected grade \\$ 3 treatment-related AEs occurred. AEs with the greatest between-arm differences were consistent with monotherapy studies that have found flu-like symptoms to be characteristic of treatment with talimogene laherparepvec[8](#page-9-0) ; these events were typically grades 1 and 2. There was no evidence that the combination was associated with cardiotoxicity, as has been reported with ipilimumab plus nivolumab,[20](#page-9-0) and there was no meaningful increase in grade \\$ 3 AEs with combination therapy.

Ipilimumab plus nivolumab improves patient outcomes, but is associated with significant toxicity. In trials evaluating ipilimumab plus nivolumab, increases in clinically significant grade \\$ 3 AEs were observed in the combination arm versus the monotherapy arm(s)[2,3](#page-9-0) ; the National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends careful patient selection and monitoring for this regimen[.21](#page-9-0) Combination regimens with lower toxicity may allow for their use in a broader range of patients. Since this study was initiated, other immune checkpoint inhibitors have been introduced for melanoma. The combination of talimogene laherparepvec with an anti\u2013programmed death-1 antibody is being evaluated in MASTERKEY-265, a phase Ib/III trial of talimogene laherparepvec plus pembrolizumab in patients with previously untreated stages IIIB to IV melanoma.[22,23](#page-9-0) Results from the phase Ib portion of MASTERKEY-265 showed a response rate . 50% with no dose-limiting toxicities; the phase III portion is enrolling patients[.22,23](#page-9-0)\n\nAlthough the outcome of this trial was positive, as a phase II study it had certain limitations. First, because of the population size of 198 patients, there were relatively small patient numbers in certain subgroups. Second, this was an open-label study without central review of investigator-assessed response. Third, the duration of follow-up at the time of this analysis limited the interpretation of time-to-event end points. Fourth, delayed ipilimumab initiation may have limited the interpretation of benefit from combination therapy. Fifth, there were between-arm differences in certain baseline characteristics (eg, disease stage/substage, visceral disease, prior therapy) that may have influenced treatment-effect estimates. However, improvement in ORR in the combination arm remained significant in a final logistic regression analysis after adjustment for potentially imbalanced covariates. Finally, differences in eligibility criteria (eg, injectable disease requirement) may confound between-study comparisons.\n\nThis randomized trial of an oncolytic immunotherapy in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor, which is the first such study to our knowledge, met its primary end point: talimogene laherparepvec plus ipilimumab resulted in a significantly higher ORR versus ipilimumab alone. The combination seems to have greater efficacy (including in uninjected and visceral lesions), without additional safety concerns versus ipilimumab alone in patients with unresected stages IIIB to IV melanoma. The combination of talimogene laherparepvec and a checkpoint inhibitor may have significant clinical utility in treatment of advanced melanoma.\n\n# AUTHORS' DISCLOSURES OF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\n\nDisclosures provided by the authors are available with this article at [jco.org](http://jco.org).\n\n# AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nConception and design: Jason Chesney, Igor Puzanov, Merrick Ross, Jennifer Gansert, Robert H.I.

To our knowledge, this was the first randomized trial to evaluate addition of an oncolytic virus to a checkpoint inhibitor.\n\n# Methods\n\nPatients with unresectable stages IIIB to IV melanoma, with no more than one prior therapy if BRAF wild-type, no more than two prior therapies if BRAF mutant, measurable/injectable disease, and without symptomatic autoimmunity or clinically significant immunosuppression were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive talimogene laherparepvec plus ipilimumab or ipilimumab alone. Talimogene laherparepvec treatment began in week 1 (first dose, # 4 mL 3 106 plaque-forming units/mL; after 3 weeks, # 4 mL 3 108 plaque-forming units/mL every 2 weeks). Ipilimumab (3 mg/kg every 3 weeks; up to four doses) began week 1 in the ipilimumab alone arm and week 6 in the combination arm. The primary end point was objective response rate evaluated by investigators per immunerelated response criteria.\n\n# Results\n\nOne hundred ninety-eight patients were randomly assigned to talimogene laherparepvec plus ipilimumab (n = 98), or ipilimumab alone (n = 100). Thirty-eight patients (39%) in the combination arm and 18 patients (18%) in the ipilimumab arm had an objective response (odds ratio, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.5 to 5.5; P = .002). Responses were not limited to injected lesions; visceral lesion decreases were observed in 52% of patients in the combination arm and 23% of patients in the ipilimumab arm. Frequently occurring adverse events (AEs) included fatigue (combination, 59%; ipilimumab alone, 42%), chills (combination, 53%; ipilimumab alone, 3%), and diarrhea (combination, 42%; ipilimumab alone, 35%). Incidence of grade \\$ 3 AEs was 45% and 35%, respectively. Three patients in the combination arm had fatal AEs; none were treatment related.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe study met its primary end point; the objective response rate was significantly higher with talimogene laherparepvec plus ipilimumab versus ipilimumab alone. These data indicate that the combination has greater antitumor activity without additional safety concerns versus ipilimumab.\n\nJ Clin Oncol 36:1658-1667. \u00a9 2017 by American Society of Clinical Oncology\n\nAppendix DOI: [https://doi.org/10.1200/JCO.](http://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JCO.2017.73.7379) [2017.73.7379](http://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JCO.2017.73.7379)\n\n![](_page_0_Picture_22.jpeg)\n\nDOI: [https://doi.org/10.1200/JCO.2017.](http://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JCO.2017.73.7379) [73.7379](http://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JCO.2017.73.7379)\n\n#### INTRODUCTION\n\nNew therapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and oncolytic viruses, have transformed patient care in advanced melanoma. Potentially, combination therapy strategies targeting complementary cancer immunity pathways could improve antitumor responses versus single-agent therapy[.1](#page-9-0) Consistent with this hypothesis, combination therapy with ipilimumab plus nivolumab improved response rates in untreated metastatic melanoma versus ipilimumab monotherapy, albeit with increased toxicity.[2,3](#page-9-0) These results advocate for evaluation of novel combinations with lower toxicity.\n\nIpilimumab is an anti\u2013cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) antibody[.4](#page-9-0) In previously treated advanced melanoma, ipilimumab improved overall response versus gp100 (10.9% v 1.5%; P , .001; complete response [CR], 1.5% v 0%)[.5](#page-9-0) In treatment-naive advanced melanoma, ipilimumab treatment resulted in an objective response rate (ORR) of 19.0% (CR, 2.2%) and median time to objective response of 2.8 months (range, 2.5 to 12.4 months).[2](#page-9-0) Improvement in overall survival (OS) with ipilimumab monotherapy relative to gp100[5](#page-9-0) and in combination with dacarbazine versus dacarbazine alone has been reported.[6](#page-9-0) Talimogene laherparepvec is a genetically modified herpes simplex virus type 1 that expresses the immunostimulatory cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulating factor.[7](#page-9-0) In the phase III single-agent registration study OPTiM talimogene laherparepvec improved durable response rate (primary end point) versus subcutaneous granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (16% v 2%; P , .001).[8](#page-9-0)\n\nTalimogene laherparepvec and ipilimumab enhance T-cell activation through different mechanisms. Talimogene laherparepvec is designed to increase tumor-specific immune activation by improving antigen presentation and T-cell priming,[9](#page-9-0) whereas CTLA-4 blockade with ipilimumab promotes T-cell expansion.[10](#page-9-0) Combining these therapies may enhance antitumor immune responses, and thereby provide greater antitumor activity than either agent alone. Specifically, we hypothesized that ipilimumab would augment systemic antitumor responses triggered by talimogene laherparepvec, yielding improved outcomes.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, we evaluated talimogene laherparepvec in combination with ipilimumab in patients with unresected advanced melanoma in a phase Ib/II study. Phase Ib results have been reported previously.[11](#page-9-0) Herein, we report the primary analysis of the randomized phase II portion, which compared talimogene laherparepvec plus ipilimumab with ipilimumab alone in patients with stages IIIB to IV melanoma.\n\n# METHODS\n\n# Patients\n\nEligible patients (\\$ 18 years of age) had histologically confirmed stages IIIB to IVM1c malignant melanoma not suitable for surgical resection, but suitable for injection (\\$ 1 cutaneous/subcutaneous/nodal lesion \\$ 5 mm in longest diameter); measurable disease per contrastenhanced or spiral computed tomography (CT; visceral lesions) or calipers (cutaneous/subcutaneous lesions); Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status # 1; and adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function. Patients were initially required to be treatment naive; however, a protocol amendment that was intended to account for the availability of new melanoma therapies allowed the enrollment of patients who had received one line of systemic anticancer therapy if BRAF wild-type or # 2 lines if BRAF mutant (one must have been a BRAF inhibitor). Patients with primary uveal or mucosal melanoma, history of melanoma in an immunodeficient state, clinically active cerebral metastases, active herpetic lesions that require systemic treatment with antiherpetic drugs, evidence of clinically significant immunosuppression, history of inflammatory bowel disease and/or other symptomatic autoimmune disease, or prior exposure to talimogene laherparepvec and/or other oncolytic immunotherapy were excluded. Prior ipilimumab therapy was permitted if patients had previously had a partial response (PR), CR, or stable disease for \\$ 6 months. Prior anti\u2013programmed death-1 or anti\u2013CTLA-4 antibody therapy was permitted if discontinuation did not result from treatment-related adverse events (AEs).\n\nPatients provided written informed consent. Institutional review boards/ethics committees at each site approved study procedures.\n\n#### Study Design\n\nThe phase II part of the study was an open-label, multicenter, randomized trial evaluating talimogene laherparepvec in combination with ipilimumab (Appendix [Fig A1,](#page-11-0) online only). Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive talimogene laherparepvec plus ipilimumab or ipilimumab alone. Before the protocol amendment, random assignment was stratified by disease stage (IIIB/IIIC/IVM1a/IVM1b v IVM1c) and BRAFV600E status (mutant v wild-type); after the amendment, random assignment was stratified by disease stage (stage IIIB/IIIC/IVM1a v IVM1b/ IVM1c) and prior therapy (treatment naive v previous systemic anticancer immunotherapy v systemic anticancer treatment other than immunotherapy) to better distinguish between patients whose disease had or had not spread beyond the skin and/or lymph nodes.\n\nIn the combination arm, talimogene laherparepvec was injected intralesionally on day 1 of week 1 at a dose of 106 plaque-forming units/mL (# 4.0 mL total injection volume; new and larger lesions were prioritized) followed by administration on day 1 of week 4, and every 2 weeks thereafter at 108 plaque-forming units/mL (# 4.0 mL)[12;](#page-9-0) ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) was administered intravenously every 3 weeks beginning on day 1 of week 6 for up to four infusions. Talimogene laherparepvec acts in the earliest stages of the cancer immunity cycle by initiating antigen release/presentation.[9](#page-9-0),[13](#page-9-0) Ipilimumab was initiated after two doses of talimogene laherparepvec to potentially maximize the agents' complementary mechanisms of action. In the ipilimumab arm, ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) was administered intravenously every 3 weeks beginning on day 1 of week 1 for up to four infusions. Talimogene laherparepvec treatment continued until CR, all injectable tumors had disappeared, confirmed disease progression per modified immune-related response criteria (irRC),[14](#page-9-0) or intolerance. Ipilimumab treatment continued for four infusions, until disease progression per irRC or unacceptable ipilimumab-related toxicity. Talimogene laherparepvec dose reductions were not permitted, other than a reduction in injection volume as a result of a reduction in lesion dimensions. Treatment could be delayed and/or withheld as a result of toxicity; delays . 4 weeks as a result of AEs resulted in permanent discontinuation. Ipilimumab dose reductions were not permitted; dosing could be withheld and/or discontinued as a result of toxicity. If talimogene laherparepvec was delayed and/or discontinued, ipilimumab treatment could continue. The study protocol includes complete dose modification rules.\n\n#### End Points\n\nThe primary end point was investigator-assessed ORR per modified irRC (Study Protocol).[14](#page-9-0) Secondary end points included OS, best overall response, disease control rate, time to response, duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS), and safety.\n\n#### Assessments\n\nRadiographic imaging was done at baseline, every 12 weeks thereafter (independent of treatment cycle) until clinically relevant disease progression, and at the safety follow-up. Tumor assessments included measurement of cutaneous/subcutaneous/nodal lesions by calipers. Radiographic assessments of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were performed by CT, positron emission tomography/CT, or magnetic resonance imaging. Response assessments were per irR[C14](#page-9-0) and required response/disease progression to be confirmed by a second consecutive clinical/radiographic assessment \\$ 4 weeks after the first documented response/disease progression. Confirmation of disease progression was only required in the absence of rapid clinical deterioration. AEs occurring during the study were recorded and graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0.\n\n#### Statistical Analysis\n\nThe planned sample size of approximately 200 patients was estimated to provide 90% power to detect a significant difference in investigatorassessed ORR with an overall two-sided 5% significance level for testing the null hypothesis of no treatment effect, assuming a range of potential ORRs <span id=\"page-2-0\"></span>in the ipilimumab arm. Assuming an ORR for ipilimumab of 15.0%, 90% power was achieved if the ORR in the combination arm was at least 35.7%. The intent-to-treat analysis set included all randomly assigned patients analyzed according to the treatment to which they were randomly assigned. The safety analysis set included all patients who received \\$ 1 dose of talimogene laherparepvec or ipilimumab, analyzed according to the treatment received. The between-arm treatment comparison in ORR was evaluated using a x<sup>2</sup> test with continuity correction with a two-sided 5% significance level.[15](#page-9-0) Exact binomial two-sided 95% CIs were calculated for each arm for ORR and disease control rate.[16](#page-9-0) Logistic regression was used to evaluate treatment effect adjusted for covariates. An unstratified log-rank test was used to compare PFS (defined as time from random assignment to the earlier of disease progression or death), time to response, and duration of response between arms. Treatment effects on PFS, time to response, and duration of response were estimated using unstratified Cox proportional hazards models; P values for these end points were descriptive. The primary analysis of OS (using an unstratified log-rank test; two-sided a = 0.05 conditional on a statistically significant ORR increase) was planned for approximately 3 years after the last patient was randomly assigned.\n\n### RESULTS\n\n# Patients\n\nBetween August 2013 and February 2016, 198 patients from 45 sites in the United States, France, and Germany were randomly assigned to talimogene laherparepvec plus ipilimumab (n = 98), or ipilimumab (n = 100). At the time of the primary analysis (August 23, 2016), five patients were continuing to receive talimogene\n\n![](_page_2_Figure_6.jpeg)\n\nFig 1. Disposition of patients in the study. (\\*) Of the 76 patients who were not randomly assigned, 57 did not meet eligibility criteria. (\u2020) Ninety-one patients in the talimogene laherparepvec plus ipilimumab arm received at least one dose of both study treatments. (\u2021) Eight patients were enrolled in the study but did not receive any study medication: talimogene laherparepvec plus ipilimumab (n = 3); ipilimumab alone (n = 5). All but one patient withdrew consent before treatment began; the remaining patient withdrew for insurance reasons. All were included in the intentto-treat analysis of efficacy.\n\nlaherparepvec and three patients (all in the combination arm) were continuing to receive ipilimumab ([Fig 1\\)](#page-2-0). Baseline characteristics were generally balanced between arms (Table 1).\n\n# Exposure\n\nThe median duration of talimogene laherparepvec treatment was 21.1 weeks; the median duration of ipilimumab treatment was 9.1 weeks in both arms. The median number of talimogene laherparepvec doses was 10 (range, 1 to 45 doses). Of the 95 patients in each arm who received treatment, 63 patients in the combination arm and 66 patients in the ipilimumab arm received four ipilimumab doses. The mean (6 standard deviation) number of ipilimumab doses administered was 3.3 (6 1.1) in the combination arm and 3.5 (6 0.9) in the ipilimumab arm. At the time of analysis, 29% of patients in the combination arm and 27% of patients in the ipilimumab arm were being followed for tumor response. The median follow-up time was 68 weeks (range, 0 to 156 weeks) in the combination arm and 58 weeks (range, 0 to 152 weeks) in the ipilimumab arm.\n\n# Response Rate\n\nThe ORR was significantly improved in the combination arm versus the ipilimumab arm. Among randomly assigned patients, 38 patients (39% [CR, 13%; PR, 26%]) in the combination arm and 18 patients (18% [CR, 7%; PR, 11%]) in the ipilimumab arm had an objective response (see footnote in [Table 2](#page-4-0)). Some patients were unevaluable for response ([Table 2\\)](#page-4-0). The between-arm difference in ORR was 20.8% (odds ratio [OR], 2.9; 95% CI, 1.5 to 5.5; x<sup>2</sup> , P = .002). Seven patients in the combination arm and one patient in the ipilimumab arm had disease progression per irRC before response.\n\nThe ORR for patients with stage IIIB/IIIC/IVM1a disease was 44% in the combination arm and 19% in the ipilimumab arm (OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.4 to 7.8; P = .007); for patients with stage IVM1b/IVM1c disease, the ORR was 33% and 16%, respectively (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 0.9 to 7.0; P = .09; [Fig 2A\\)](#page-5-0). Among BRAF wildtype patients, the ORR was 42% (26 of 62 patients) in the combination arm versus 10% (six of 60 patients) in the ipilimumab arm (OR, 6.5; 95% CI, 2.4 to 17.4; P , .001). Among patients with BRAF-mutant tumors, the ORR was 34% (12 of 35 patients) in the combination arm versus 32% (11 of 34 patients) in the ipilimumab arm (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.4 to 3.0; P = 1.0; [Fig](#page-5-0) [2A\\)](#page-5-0). The estimated OR for treatment effect in a stepwise logistic regression model was 2.73 (P = .004; Appendix [Table A1](#page-11-0), online only).\n\nThe median time to response was 5.8 months (95% CI, 5.4 to 10.9 months) in the combination arm (n = 38) and not estimable (95% CI, not estimable) in the ipilimumab arm (n = 18; HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 0.8 to 2.5; [Table 2](#page-4-0)). The median duration of response was not reached in either arm [\\(Table 2](#page-4-0)). At the time of analysis, 89% of patients in the combination arm and 83% of patients in the ipilimumab arm with a response remained in response. The disease control rate was 58% in the combination arm and 42% in the ipilimumab arm (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1 to 3.4; P = .033; [Table 2\\)](#page-4-0).

There was no confirmation for unevaluable or stable disease; however, stable disease duration must have been . 77 days.\n\n\u2020Patients could be classified as unevaluable if (1) they had a single unconfirmed evaluation of progressive disease at the last assessment before data cutoff, (2) all postbaseline response assessments were classified as unevaluable, or (3) patients were evaluated as having stable disease with no subsequent tumor evaluation after 77 days from randomization. The highest incidence of assessment of unevaluable was because of unconfirmed progressive disease: combination arm (n = 2), ipilimumab arm (n = 10); the remaining patients had stable disease before 77 days from random assignment: combination arm (n = 1), ipilimumab arm (n = 3); had all postbaseline assessments classified as unevaluable: combination arm ( n = 1), ipilimumab arm (n = 3), or were in the study awaiting potential confirmation of progressive disease: ipilimumab arm (n = 1).\n\n\u2021Radiographic imaging or clinical measurement of index lesions was not performed at any postbaseline time point. The highest incidence of assessment of \"not done\" was because of patients not receiving study treatment: combination arm (n = 3), ipilimumab arm (n = 5). Imaging was also not done for patients who had early end of treatment or end of response before the first scheduled assessment: combination arm (n = 3), ipilimumab arm (n = 3).\n\n\u00a7P value is descriptive. kThe median time to response in the ipilimumab alone arm could not be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier technique.\n\n\u00b6Plus sign indicates response is ongoing.\n\n22 patients in the ipilimumab arm with evaluable visceral metastasis disease burdens, 16 (52%) and 5 (23%), respectively, had a decrease in visceral lesion burden [\\(Fig 3D](#page-6-0)).\n\n# Progression-Free Survival\n\nPFS analysis was descriptive [\\(Fig 4](#page-7-0)). Fifty-two of 98 patients (53%) in the combination arm and 51 of 100 patients (51%) in the ipilimumab arm had PFS events. The median PFS was 8.2 months (95% CI, 4.2 to 21.5 months) in the combination arm and 6.4 months (95% CI, 3.2 to 16.5 months) in the ipilimumab arm (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.23; P = .35). PFS was defined as time from random assignment to the earlier of disease progression or death; consequently, patients in the combination arm initiated ipilimumab therapy 5 weeks later than patients in the ipilimumab arm and had received only two ipilimumab doses at the first response assessment (12 weeks). At data cutoff, 20 of 98 patients (20%) in the combination arm and 23 of 100 patients (23%) in the ipilimumab arm had died. The HR for OS was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.44 to 1.46).\n\n# Safety\n\nNinety-three patients (98%) in the combination arm and 90 patients (95%) in the ipilimumab arm had \\$ 1 AE ([Table 3](#page-8-0)). Incidences of grade \\$ 3 AEs were 45% and 35%, respectively. The most frequently occurring AEs and events with greatest betweenarm differences in incidence were similar to those seen in other talimogene laherparepvec[8](#page-9-0) and ipilimumab studies[2](#page-9-0),[5](#page-9-0) and included fatigue (59%, 42%), chills (53%, 3%), diarrhea (42%, 35%), pruritus (40%, 36%), rash (39%, 28%), and nausea (38%, 24%, respectively; [Table 3\\)](#page-8-0). The incidence of grade \\$ 3 ipilimumab-related AEs was 19% in the combination arm and 18% in the ipilimumab arm; the most frequently occurring were GI disorders (colitis: 5%, 4%; diarrhea: 3%, 3%; autoimmune colitis: 2%, 3%, respectively).

Kaplan-Meier estimate of progressionfree survival (PFS). (\\*) P value is descriptive.\n\nAEs was 15%; the most frequently occurring were influenza-like illness (4%) and lymphopenia (4%). Two patients (2%) in the combination arm discontinued talimogene laherparepvec as a result of AEs; 12 patients (13%) in the combination arm and 16 patients (17%) in the ipilimumab arm discontinued ipilimumab as a result of AEs. Three patients in the combination arm had fatal AEs (myocardial infarction [n = 1], and disease progression [n = 2]); none were considered treatment related.\n\n#### DISCUSSION\n\nThis study, which to our knowledge is the first to evaluate an oncolytic virus in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor, met its primary end point: talimogene laherparepvec plus ipilimumab resulted in a significantly higher ORR versus ipilimumab alone (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.5 to 5.5; P = .002). Responses occurred in patients with and without visceral disease and in uninjected lesions after combination treatment. The confirmed ORR (39%) in the combination arm is higher than historical controls of either agent administered as monotherapy (ipilimumab, 11% to 19%[2](#page-9-0),[5](#page-9-0),[17,18](#page-9-0); talimogene laherparepvec, 26%[8](#page-9-0) ). In OPTiM, talimogene laherparepvec monotherapy was associated with a \\$ 50% size decrease in 64% of injected lesions and 15% of visceral lesions,[19](#page-9-0) suggesting that additional responses might be achievable through the addition of T-cell checkpoint inhibition. In the previously reported phase Ib portion, we observed changes in T-cell subsets consistent with this hypothesis,[11](#page-9-0) and, in this phase II portion, we found evidence of enhanced systemic antitumor response. Individual lesion-type analysis indicated that responses occurred in both injected and uninjected tumor burden. The higher rate of decrease (combination arm, 52%; ipilimumab arm, 23%) and higher rate of complete reduction in visceral tumor burden (combination arm, 23%; ipilimumab arm, 0%) is consistent with a systemic effect of the combination because talimogene laherparepvec was not injected into these lesions. The nonvisceral uninjected lesion tumor burden response was similar across arms. However, the number of patients in this category in the combination arm was smaller than in the control arm because patients with injected nonvisceral lesions were excluded. These results indicate that the combination elicited a greater systemic antitumor response than could be achieved with either agent alone.\n\nResponse rate favored the combination arm for both diseasestage subsets (IIIB/IIIC/IVM1a, 44% v 19%; IVM1b/IVM1c, 33% v 16%). Although response rates were high in patients with both BRAF wild-type and BRAF-mutant tumors, the effect size favoring combination treatment was greater in the BRAF wild-type subgroup (42% v 10%). The response rate was also greater in the combination arm for patients with BRAF wild-type versus BRAFmutant tumors (42% v 34%). Although small patient numbers in these subgroups may have contributed to this finding, similar results were observed in a previous phase III study of ipilimumab plus nivolumab.[3](#page-9-0) Treatment effect differences between BRAFmutant and BRAF wild-type subgroups might reflect differences in biologic response to the combination; however, we cannot exclude the possibility that they were driven by other patient and/or tumor characteristics.\n\nDespite ipilimumab treatment starting 5 weeks later in the combination arm, PFS was 8.2 months in the combination arm versus 6.4 months in the ipilimumab arm (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.23). The median PFS in the combination arm was also greater than that previously observed in ipilimumab monotherapy studies (2.8 to 2.9 months)[5,17,18](#page-9-0) and similar to the median time to treatment failure in the OPTiM study (8.2 months).[8](#page-9-0) The analysis of OS was immature; patients are still being followed for response and OS.\n\nToxicity observed with the combination was consistent with expectations from the phase Ib study.[11](#page-9-0) The incidence of grade \\$ 3 ipilimumab-related toxicities was similar between arms; no unexpected grade \\$ 3 treatment-related AEs occurred. AEs with the greatest between-arm differences were consistent with monotherapy studies that have found flu-like symptoms to be characteristic of treatment with talimogene laherparepvec[8](#page-9-0) ; these events were typically grades 1 and 2. There was no evidence that the combination was associated with cardiotoxicity, as has been reported with ipilimumab plus nivolumab,[20](#page-9-0) and there was no meaningful increase in grade \\$ 3 AEs with combination therapy. Overall, combination treatment was not associated with unexpected AEs or increase in incidence or severity of AEs, suggesting\n\n# Chesney et al\n\n<span id=\"page-8-0\"></span>\n\n| Table 3.

Ipilimumab plus nivolumab improves patient outcomes, but is associated with significant toxicity. In trials evaluating ipilimumab plus nivolumab, increases in clinically significant grade \\$ 3 AEs were observed in the combination arm versus the monotherapy arm(s)[2,3](#page-9-0) ; the National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends careful patient selection and monitoring for this regimen[.21](#page-9-0) Combination regimens with lower toxicity may allow for their use in a broader range of patients. Since this study was initiated, other immune checkpoint inhibitors have been introduced for melanoma. The combination of talimogene laherparepvec with an anti\u2013programmed death-1 antibody is being evaluated in MASTERKEY-265, a phase Ib/III trial of talimogene laherparepvec plus pembrolizumab in patients with previously untreated stages IIIB to IV melanoma.[22,23](#page-9-0) Results from the phase Ib portion of MASTERKEY-265 showed a response rate . 50% with no dose-limiting toxicities; the phase III portion is enrolling patients[.22,23](#page-9-0)\n\nAlthough the outcome of this trial was positive, as a phase II study it had certain limitations. First, because of the population size of 198 patients, there were relatively small patient numbers in certain subgroups. Second, this was an open-label study without central review of investigator-assessed response. Third, the duration of follow-up at the time of this analysis limited the interpretation of time-to-event end points. Fourth, delayed ipilimumab initiation may have limited the interpretation of benefit from combination therapy. Fifth, there were between-arm differences in certain baseline characteristics (eg, disease stage/substage, visceral disease, prior therapy) that may have influenced treatment-effect estimates. However, improvement in ORR in the combination arm remained significant in a final logistic regression analysis after adjustment for potentially imbalanced covariates. Finally, differences in eligibility criteria (eg, injectable disease requirement) may confound between-study comparisons.\n\nThis randomized trial of an oncolytic immunotherapy in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor, which is the first such study to our knowledge, met its primary end point: talimogene laherparepvec plus ipilimumab resulted in a significantly higher ORR versus ipilimumab alone. The combination seems to have greater efficacy (including in uninjected and visceral lesions), without additional safety concerns versus ipilimumab alone in patients with unresected stages IIIB to IV melanoma. The combination of talimogene laherparepvec and a checkpoint inhibitor may have significant clinical utility in treatment of advanced melanoma.\n\n# AUTHORS' DISCLOSURES OF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\n\nDisclosures provided by the authors are available with this article at [jco.org](http://jco.org).\n\n# AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nConception and design: Jason Chesney, Igor Puzanov, Merrick Ross, Jennifer Gansert, Robert H.I.

DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1414428** *Copyright \u00a9 2015 Massachusetts Medical Society.* In a phase 1 dose-escalation study, combined inhibition of T-cell checkpoint pathways by nivolumab and ipilimumab was associated with a high rate of objective response, including complete responses, among patients with advanced melanoma.\n\n#### **Methods**\n\nIn this double-blind study involving 142 patients with metastatic melanoma who had not previously received treatment, we randomly assigned patients in a 2:1 ratio to receive ipilimumab (3 mg per kilogram of body weight) combined with either nivolumab (1 mg per kilogram) or placebo once every 3 weeks for four doses, followed by nivolumab (3 mg per kilogram) or placebo every 2 weeks until the occurrence of disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects. The primary end point was the rate of investigator-assessed, confirmed objective response among patients with *BRAF* V600 wild-type tumors.\n\n#### **Results**\n\nAmong patients with *BRAF* wild-type tumors, the rate of confirmed objective response was 61% (44 of 72 patients) in the group that received both ipilimumab and nivolumab (combination group) versus 11% (4 of 37 patients) in the group that received ipilimumab and placebo (ipilimumab-monotherapy group) (P<0.001), with complete responses reported in 16 patients (22%) in the combination group and no patients in the ipilimumab-monotherapy group. The median duration of response was not reached in either group. The median progression-free survival was not reached with the combination therapy and was 4.4 months with ipilimumab monotherapy (hazard ratio associated with combination therapy as compared with ipilimumab monotherapy for disease progression or death, 0.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.23 to 0.68; P<0.001). Similar results for response rate and progression-free survival were observed in 33 patients with *BRAF* mutation\u2013positive tumors. Drug-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were reported in 54% of the patients who received the combination therapy as compared with 24% of the patients who received ipilimumab monotherapy. Select adverse events with potential immunologic causes were consistent with those in a phase 1 study, and most of these events resolved with immune-modulating medication.\n\n## **Conclusions**\n\nThe objective-response rate and the progression-free survival among patients with advanced melanoma who had not previously received treatment were significantly greater with nivolumab combined with ipilimumab than with ipilimumab monotherapy. Combination therapy had an acceptable safety profile.

For personal use only.\n\nRecent approaches to the treatment of metastatic melanoma enhance antitumor immunity by blocking immune checkpoints, such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte\u2013associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and the programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor. Ipilimumab, an anti\u2013CTLA-4 antibody, is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the basis of improvement in overall survival among patients with advanced melanoma, with objective responses in approximately 11% of the patients.1,2 Nivolumab, an anti\u2013PD-1 monoclonal antibody, has recently been shown to improve overall survival, as compared with dacarbazine (objective response rate, 40% vs. 14%), among previously untreated patients with advanced *BRAF* wild-type melanoma.3 Nivolumab is approved by the FDA on the basis of an improvement in confirmed objective responses, as compared with chemotherapy (32% vs. 11%), among patients with metastatic melanoma who have disease progression after treatment with ipilimumab or a BRAF inhibitor.<sup>4</sup>\n\nTargeted therapies, such as BRAF and MEK inhibitors that are approved for the treatment of patients with advanced melanoma who harbor *BRAF* V600 mutation\u2013positive tumors, result in a high rate of initial tumor responses, with a significant survival advantage over dacarbazine; however, the median duration of response is less than 1 year.5-12 Therefore, there is a need for new treatment options, particularly for the 50 to 60% of patients with *BRAF* wild-type melanoma.\n\nCTLA-4 and PD-1 inhibit antitumor immunity through complementary and nonredundant mechanisms.13 Preclinical models have shown that dual blockade, as compared with blockade of either pathway alone, synergistically improves antitumor responses.14,15 High rates of objective response (including complete responses), a prolonged duration of response, and a favorable overall survival rate of 79% at 2 years were observed in a phase 1 dose-escalation study involving patients with advanced melanoma who received the combination regimen of nivolumab and ipilimumab.16,17 Here, we report the results of a randomized, double-blind trial comparing nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab with standard-of-care ipilimumab monotherapy as a first-line treatment in patients with advanced melanoma.\n\n## Methods\n\n## **Patients**\n\nEligible patients had histologically confirmed, unresectable, previously untreated stage III or IV melanoma with measurable disease. Other inclusion criteria included a known *BRAF* V600 mutation status, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance-status score of 0 or 1 (on a scale of 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no symptoms and higher scores indicating greater disability), and the availability of tumor tissue from a metastatic or unresectable site for immunohistochemical assessment of PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) expression. Key exclusion criteria were active brain metastases, uveal melanoma, and serious autoimmune disease.\n\n#### **Study Design and Treatment**\n\nPatients were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio and in a double-blinded manner, to receive both nivolumab and ipilimumab (combination group) or ipilimumab alone (ipilimumab-monotherapy group). Randomization was stratified according to *BRAF* mutation status (V600 wild-type vs. mutation-positive). In the combination group, nivolumab was administered intravenously at a dose of 1 mg per kilogram of body weight over a period of 60 minutes, once every 3 weeks for four doses. Thirty minutes after the completion of each nivolumab infusion, patients received 3 mg of ipilimumab per kilogram over a period of 90 minutes. After the fourth dose of both agents, ipilimumab was discontinued, and thereafter (maintenance phase), nivolumab was administered as a single agent at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram over a period of 60 minutes, once every 2 weeks.\n\nIn the ipilimumab-monotherapy group, the same dosing schedule was used, except that nivolumab was replaced with matched placebo during both the combination and maintenance portions of the trial. Treatment was continued as long as clinical benefit (as defined by the investigator) was observed or until unacceptable side effects occurred.\n\nPatients who had investigator-assessed disease progression could be treated beyond progression (with blinding maintained) or have blinded study therapy discontinued (after which time the treatment assignment could be disclosed to the investigator and patient). After unblinding, patients in the ipilimumab-monotherapy group had the op-\n\ntion of receiving nivolumab at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram every 2 weeks until further disease progression, and patients in the combination group were required to discontinue treatment (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org).\n\nThe primary end point was the rate of investigator-assessed, confirmed objective response among patients with *BRAF* V600 wild-type tumors. The primary end point was restricted to this group of patients because at the time of study enrollment, approved treatment options were limited for these patients and only ipilimumab had shown an overall survival benefit in a randomized, controlled trial. Secondary end points included investigator-assessed progression-free survival in patients with *BRAF* wild-type tumors, the objective response rate and progression-free survival among patients with *BRAF* V600 mutation\u2013positive tumors, and safety.\n\n#### **Assessments**\n\nTumor response was assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1,18 at the following time points: 12 weeks after the first treatment, every 6 weeks thereafter for the first year, then every 12 weeks until disease progression or discontinuation of treatment. Safety evaluations were performed in patients who had received at least one dose of study treatment, and the severity of adverse events was graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0.19 Guidelines for the management of adverse events were provided by the sponsor and are available in the Supplementary Appendix.\n\n#### **Study Oversight**\n\nThe study protocol, available along with the most recent version of the statistical analysis plan at NEJM.org, was approved by the institutional review board at each participating center. The study was conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki and International Conference on Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. All the patients provided written informed consent. An independent radiology review committee was established to provide a sensitivity assessment of objective responses, and a data and safety monitoring committee provided general oversight. Data were collected by the sponsor, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and were analyzed in collaboration with the authors. The authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and the fidelity of the study to the protocol.

Patients with *BRAF* V600 mutation\u2013positive tumors were eligible for the study, with approximately 50 planned to undergo randomization. Analyses in the population with *BRAF* V600 mutation\u2013positive tumors were intended to be descriptive only and were not part of the sample-size consideration. Given a two-sided alpha level of 0.05, we calculated that the sample of 100 patients with *BRAF* wild-type tumors would give the study approximately 87% power to detect a significant difference in the objective response rate between the combination group and the ipilimumab-monotherapy group, assuming an objective response rate of 40% versus 10%. In order to preserve an experiment-wide type I error rate of 5%, a hierarchical testing approach was applied to key secondary end points after analysis of the primary end point of the objective response rate in all patients with *BRAF* wild-type tumors who underwent randomization. Of the key secondary end points, the objective response rate among all randomly assigned patients was tested first, followed by testing of progression-free survival among all patients with *BRAF* wild-type tumors who under-\n\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\n\nDownloaded from nejm.org at Chalmers Tekniska Hogskola on June 16, 2025.

At trial entry, the majority of patients (87%) had stage IV disease according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system, and 46% of the patients had tumors characterized as M1c disease (metastases to visceral sites other than skin, subcutaneous, distant lymph nodes, or lung, or distant metastases to any site along with elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase level). Elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels were observed in 35 patients (25%), and 23% of the patients had *BRAF* V600 mutation\u2013positive tumors. Of 118 patients whose PD-L1 expression could be evaluated, 35 (30%) had PD-L1\u2013positive tumors.\n\nFrom September 16, 2013, to February 6, 2014, a total of 179 patients were screened in the United States and France, and 142 patients (109 with *BRAF* wild-type tumors and 33 with *BRAF* V600 mutation\u2013positive tumors) were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Clinical database lock for the results reported here occurred on January 30, 2015, with a minimum follow-up period of 11 months after randomization.\n\n#### **Efficacy**\n\nThe rate of investigator-assessed, confirmed objective response among the patients with *BRAF* wild-type tumors was 61% (95% confidence interval [CI], 49 to 72) in the combination group, versus 11% (95% CI, 3 to 25) in the ipilimumabmonotherapy group (odds ratio, 12.96; 95% CI, 3.91 to 54.49; P<0.001) (Table 2). A complete response was observed in 16 patients (22%) in the combination group and no patients in the ipilimumab-monotherapy group. Figure 1A shows the distribution of tumor-burden change from baseline among patients with *BRAF* wild-type tumors. The median change in investigator-assessed tumor volume was a 68.1% decrease in the combination group and a 5.5% increase in the ipilimumab-monotherapy group.\n\nAmong the patients with *BRAF* wild-type tumors who underwent randomization, the median duration of response was not reached in either group, with an ongoing response observed in 36 of the 44 patients with a response (82%) in the combination group and in 3 of the 4 patients with a response (75%) in the ipilimumab-monotherapy group (Fig. 1B). The time to a response did not differ significantly between the groups, with the majority of all responses observed at the time the first scan was obtained (Fig. 1B).\n\nAmong patients with *BRAF* mutation\u2013positive tumors, the objective response rate was 52% (12 of 23 patients) in the combination group, with the percentage of complete responses (22% [5 patients]) similar to that in patients with *BRAF* wildtype tumors (Table 2). In the population with *BRAF* wild-type tumors, the median progressionfree survival was not reached with the combination therapy and was 4.4 months (95% CI, 2.8 to 5.7) with ipilimumab monotherapy (hazard ratio associated with combination therapy as compared with ipilimumab monotherapy for disease progression or death, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.68; P<0.001) (Fig. 1C). Among patients with *BRAF* mutation\u2013positive tumors, the median progression-free survival was 8.5 months (95% CI, 2.8 to not estimable) in the combination group and 2.7 months (95% CI, 1.0 to 5.4) in the ipilimumabmonotherapy group (hazard ratio associated with combination therapy as compared with ipilimumab monotherapy for disease progression or death, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.15 to 1.00) (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Among all randomly assigned patients who discontinued study treatment owing to toxic effects, the objective response rate was 68% (95% CI, 52 to 81) in the combination group (30 of 44 patients), as compared with 10% (95% CI, 0 to 45) in the ipilimumab-monotherapy group (1 of 10 patients).\n\nIn patients with *BRAF* wild-type tumors, the response benefit with the nivolumab-and-ipilimumab combination, as compared with ipilimumab alone, was observed across all prespecified patient subgroups, including patients with stage M1c disease and those with elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). In the combination group, the objective response rate was independent of tumor PD-L1 status: 58% (95% CI, 37 to 78) among patients with PD-L1\u2013positive tumors and 55% (95% CI, 41 to 69) among patients with PD-L1\u2013negative tumors (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). In the ipilimumab-monotherapy group, a numerically higher objective re-\n\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.

The calculation of the confidence interval (CI) was based on the Clopper\u2013Pearson method. The estimated odds ratio for nivolumab plus ipilimumab as compared with ipilimumab alone was 12.96 (95% CI, 3.91 to 54.49) among patients with *BRAF* wild-type tumors (P<0.001) and 9.82 (95% CI, 0.99 to 465.39) among patients with *BRAF* V600 mutation\u2013positive tumors (P value was not calculated, per the statistical analysis plan).\n\nsponse rate was observed among patients with PD-L1\u2013positive tumors than among patients with PD-L1\u2013negative tumors (18% [95% CI, 2 to 52] vs. 4% [95% CI, 0 to 19]).\n\n#### **Safety**\n\nIn the combination group, 59% and 57% of the patients received at least four doses of nivolumab and ipilimumab, respectively; in the ipilimumab monotherapy group, 70% of the patients received at least four doses of ipilimumab (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The rate of treatmentrelated adverse events, as assessed by the investigators, was 91% in the combination group and 93% in the ipilimumab-monotherapy group (Table 3). Drug-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were reported more frequently in the combination group than in the ipilimumab-monotherapy group (54% vs. 24%); in patients who received the combination regimen, the onset of most adverse events occurred during the combination phase rather than the maintenance (nivolumab-monotherapy) phase. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events associated with the combination therapy were colitis (17%), diarrhea (11%), and an elevated alanine aminotransferase level (11%). Diarrhea was the most frequently reported grade 3 or 4 adverse event associated with ipilimumab monotherapy (11%), followed by colitis (7%).\n\nSelect adverse events of potentially immune-\n\nmediated cause occurred most frequently in the skin, gastrointestinal, endocrine, and hepatic organ categories (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix) and were observed more frequently with combination therapy than with ipilimumab monotherapy. Immunosuppressive medications for the management of adverse events, including topical agents for dermatologic adverse events, were used in a higher percentage of patients in the combination group than in the ipilimumab group (89% vs. 59%). The most commonly used systemic immunosuppressive agents across both treatment groups were glucocorticoids (82% of the patients in the combination group and 50% of the patients in the ipilimumab-monotherapy group). Infliximab was administered to 13% and 9% of the patients in the respective groups for adverse-event management. Hormone-replacement therapy was used to manage endocrine adverse events. Of 46 grade 3 or 4 drug-related select adverse events in the combination group that were managed with immunomodulatory medication, the majority (approximately 80%) resolved completely, or symptoms returned to baseline levels (Table 4). There was a similar resolution rate across organ categories in both treatment groups.\n\nThe most common reason for discontinuation of study treatment was drug-related adverse events in the combination group (45%) and disease progression in the ipilimumab-monothera-\n\nn engl j med 372;21 nejm.org may 21, 2015 2011\n\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.

The dashed line indicates the 30% reduction in tumor burden that is consistent with a response to treatment according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1. Panel B shows the durability of tumor regressions in patients with advanced melanoma with *BRAF* wildtype tumors who had objective responses to the combination regimen or ipilimumab monotherapy according to conventional RECIST guidelines.

After the initial four doses, 40% of the patients in the combination group continued to receive nivolumab as monotherapy (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).\n\nThe number of reported deaths among treated patients was 25 in the combination group (27%) and 17 in the ipilimumab-monotherapy group (37%); most deaths were due to progressive disease. Three deaths were related to the combination therapy according to investigator assessment \u2014 one patient with a history of cardiac disease died from ventricular arrhythmia 29 days after the last dose of study treatment; the second died suddenly 69 days after the last dose while clinically improving from pneumonitis and having an iatrogenic pneumothorax. The third patient died suddenly 86 days after the last dose of study treatment (3 days after the resolution of grade 3 pneumonia and grade 4 hypercalcemia). None of the deaths in the ipilimumabmonotherapy group were deemed to be related to the study drug.\n\n## Discussion\n\nIn this double-blind, randomized study, the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab resulted in a significantly higher objective response rate, more frequent complete responses, and significantly longer progression-free survival than ipilimumab alone among previously untreated patients with advanced melanoma. The confirmed response rate associated with the combination therapy in this trial (61%) is numerically higher than the 40% response rate that was recently reported with nivolumab monotherapy as first-line therapy in patients with advanced melanoma who have *BRAF* wild-type tumors and also higher than the rate observed in trials of monotherapy with pembrolizumab, another anti\u2013PD-1 agent.<sup>20</sup> However, it is inherently difficult to compare the efficacy of the combination therapy with that of anti\u2013PD-1 monotherapy, because the demographic characteristics of the patients differed among the trials.\n\nOn the basis of the high degree of tumor reduction in the current study, with a high rate of complete responses (22% among the patients with *BRAF* wild-type tumors who were assigned to the combination therapy), a favorable clinical benefit can be anticipated with longer follow-up. Overall, the characteristics of response observed with nivolumab plus ipilimumab in the current study are consistent with results reported previously,16,17 with most responses occurring by the time of the first tumor assessment and, in many patients, responses continuing despite discontinuation of therapy. The response rate associated with the combination regimen in this current phase 2 study was even higher than response rates reported previously, which may be explained by the fact that the patient population in this study was previously untreated. A prior phase 1 trial of the combination regimen at varying doses showed high rates of overall survival at 1 year (85%) and 2 years (79%).16,17\n\nThe primary end point of this study specifically addressed patients with *BRAF* wild-type melanoma because at the time of study enrollment, ipilimumab was the only approved therapy for this group of patients that had shown an overall survival benefit in a randomized phase 3 trial. Although BRAF inhibitors as single agents and BRAF inhibitor\u2013MEK inhibitor combinations can result in high response rates among patients with *BRAF*-mutant melanoma,14,15,21 no\n\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.

the first dose of study treatment and within 100 days after the last dose of study treatment.\n\n\u2020 Shown are events that were reported in at least 10% of the patients in either study group.\n\n\u2021 Diarrhea was defined as a disorder characterized by frequent and watery bowel movements; colitis was defined as a disorder characterized by inflammation of the colon. Grade 3 or 4 drug-related adverse events were reported more frequently in the combination group than in the ipilimumab-monotherapy group; in patients who received the combination regimen, most adverse events had first onset during the combination phase rather than the maintenance (nivolumab-monotherapy) phase.\n\n\u00a7 One additional patient in the ipilimumab-monotherapy group had progressive disease on April 28, 2014, and data were unblinded before the patient started nivolumab monotherapy a day later. This patient received 10 cycles of nivolumab monotherapy before the onset of pneumonitis after the last dose on September 25, 2014.\n\nsingle agent or combination of agents has similarly been shown to result in a high response rate among patients with *BRAF* wild-type melanoma. Nevertheless, among patients with *BRAF*mutant melanoma, the overall response rate and progression-free survival associated with the combination regimen were also substantially higher than those with ipilimumab alone. These results are consistent with the results of a previous phase 1 trial and suggest that the presence of the *BRAF* V600 mutation does not influence the efficacy of checkpoint blockade.16,17,22\n\nIn general, the spectrum of select adverse events that we observed was consistent with previous experience with the combination therapy.16 Three deaths related to the combination regimen were reported in this study; these deaths could be linked to preexisting conditions that were related to the cause of death or that required medical procedures that might have contributed to the death. The proportion of patients who had a grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse event was higher with the nivolumaband-ipilimumab combination than with ipilimumab monotherapy (54% vs. 24%). Select grade 3 or 4 adverse events generally occurred within the first 15 weeks of treatment with the combination regimen and typically required less than 9 weeks to resolve, depending on the specific adverse event. Aside from patients with endocrinopathies, which typically require continued hormone-replacement therapy, the majority of patients\n\n| Table 4.

It is noteworthy that of the patients who discontinued combination treatment owing to toxic effects, 68% had an objective response and most continue to have a response.\n\nPositive expression of PD-L1, one of the ligands of PD-1, has been associated with increased response rates among patients treated with nivolumab as a single agent.23,24 Among patients treated with the combination regimen in our study, however, there was no significant difference in response rates between patients whose pretreatment tumors were defined as PD-L1\u2013positive and those whose tumors were PD-L1\u2013negative. These data suggest that PD-L1 should not be used to select patients to receive combination treatment. The mechanism for response independent of baseline PD-L1 status remains unclear. It is possible that ipilimumab drives T cells into the tumor and that this T-cell infiltration during treatment leads to a more favorable microenvironment for anti\u2013PD-1 efficacy.25,26 It is also possible that assessment of PD-L1 status with the incorporation of PD-L1\u2013expressing tumor-infiltrating macrophages or T cells (rather than tumor cells, as in our study) may be most relevant, but this possibility requires additional investigation.\n\nIn summary, the combination of ipilimumab plus nivolumab resulted in durable responses and\n\n#### **References**\n\n**2.** Robert C, Thomas L, Bondarenko I, et al.

DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1414428** *Copyright \u00a9 2015 Massachusetts Medical Society.* In a phase 1 dose-escalation study, combined inhibition of T-cell checkpoint pathways by nivolumab and ipilimumab was associated with a high rate of objective response, including complete responses, among patients with advanced melanoma.\n\n#### **Methods**\n\nIn this double-blind study involving 142 patients with metastatic melanoma who had not previously received treatment, we randomly assigned patients in a 2:1 ratio to receive ipilimumab (3 mg per kilogram of body weight) combined with either nivolumab (1 mg per kilogram) or placebo once every 3 weeks for four doses, followed by nivolumab (3 mg per kilogram) or placebo every 2 weeks until the occurrence of disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects. The primary end point was the rate of investigator-assessed, confirmed objective response among patients with *BRAF* V600 wild-type tumors.\n\n#### **Results**\n\nAmong patients with *BRAF* wild-type tumors, the rate of confirmed objective response was 61% (44 of 72 patients) in the group that received both ipilimumab and nivolumab (combination group) versus 11% (4 of 37 patients) in the group that received ipilimumab and placebo (ipilimumab-monotherapy group) (P<0.001), with complete responses reported in 16 patients (22%) in the combination group and no patients in the ipilimumab-monotherapy group. The median duration of response was not reached in either group. The median progression-free survival was not reached with the combination therapy and was 4.4 months with ipilimumab monotherapy (hazard ratio associated with combination therapy as compared with ipilimumab monotherapy for disease progression or death, 0.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.23 to 0.68; P<0.001). Similar results for response rate and progression-free survival were observed in 33 patients with *BRAF* mutation\u2013positive tumors. Drug-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were reported in 54% of the patients who received the combination therapy as compared with 24% of the patients who received ipilimumab monotherapy. Select adverse events with potential immunologic causes were consistent with those in a phase 1 study, and most of these events resolved with immune-modulating medication.\n\n## **Conclusions**\n\nThe objective-response rate and the progression-free survival among patients with advanced melanoma who had not previously received treatment were significantly greater with nivolumab combined with ipilimumab than with ipilimumab monotherapy. Combination therapy had an acceptable safety profile.

For personal use only.\n\nRecent approaches to the treatment of metastatic melanoma enhance antitumor immunity by blocking immune checkpoints, such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte\u2013associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and the programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor. Ipilimumab, an anti\u2013CTLA-4 antibody, is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the basis of improvement in overall survival among patients with advanced melanoma, with objective responses in approximately 11% of the patients.1,2 Nivolumab, an anti\u2013PD-1 monoclonal antibody, has recently been shown to improve overall survival, as compared with dacarbazine (objective response rate, 40% vs. 14%), among previously untreated patients with advanced *BRAF* wild-type melanoma.3 Nivolumab is approved by the FDA on the basis of an improvement in confirmed objective responses, as compared with chemotherapy (32% vs. 11%), among patients with metastatic melanoma who have disease progression after treatment with ipilimumab or a BRAF inhibitor.<sup>4</sup>\n\nTargeted therapies, such as BRAF and MEK inhibitors that are approved for the treatment of patients with advanced melanoma who harbor *BRAF* V600 mutation\u2013positive tumors, result in a high rate of initial tumor responses, with a significant survival advantage over dacarbazine; however, the median duration of response is less than 1 year.5-12 Therefore, there is a need for new treatment options, particularly for the 50 to 60% of patients with *BRAF* wild-type melanoma.\n\nCTLA-4 and PD-1 inhibit antitumor immunity through complementary and nonredundant mechanisms.13 Preclinical models have shown that dual blockade, as compared with blockade of either pathway alone, synergistically improves antitumor responses.14,15 High rates of objective response (including complete responses), a prolonged duration of response, and a favorable overall survival rate of 79% at 2 years were observed in a phase 1 dose-escalation study involving patients with advanced melanoma who received the combination regimen of nivolumab and ipilimumab.16,17 Here, we report the results of a randomized, double-blind trial comparing nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab with standard-of-care ipilimumab monotherapy as a first-line treatment in patients with advanced melanoma.\n\n## Methods\n\n## **Patients**\n\nEligible patients had histologically confirmed, unresectable, previously untreated stage III or IV melanoma with measurable disease. Other inclusion criteria included a known *BRAF* V600 mutation status, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance-status score of 0 or 1 (on a scale of 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no symptoms and higher scores indicating greater disability), and the availability of tumor tissue from a metastatic or unresectable site for immunohistochemical assessment of PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) expression. Key exclusion criteria were active brain metastases, uveal melanoma, and serious autoimmune disease.\n\n#### **Study Design and Treatment**\n\nPatients were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio and in a double-blinded manner, to receive both nivolumab and ipilimumab (combination group) or ipilimumab alone (ipilimumab-monotherapy group). Randomization was stratified according to *BRAF* mutation status (V600 wild-type vs. mutation-positive). In the combination group, nivolumab was administered intravenously at a dose of 1 mg per kilogram of body weight over a period of 60 minutes, once every 3 weeks for four doses. Thirty minutes after the completion of each nivolumab infusion, patients received 3 mg of ipilimumab per kilogram over a period of 90 minutes. After the fourth dose of both agents, ipilimumab was discontinued, and thereafter (maintenance phase), nivolumab was administered as a single agent at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram over a period of 60 minutes, once every 2 weeks.\n\nIn the ipilimumab-monotherapy group, the same dosing schedule was used, except that nivolumab was replaced with matched placebo during both the combination and maintenance portions of the trial. Treatment was continued as long as clinical benefit (as defined by the investigator) was observed or until unacceptable side effects occurred.\n\nPatients who had investigator-assessed disease progression could be treated beyond progression (with blinding maintained) or have blinded study therapy discontinued (after which time the treatment assignment could be disclosed to the investigator and patient). After unblinding, patients in the ipilimumab-monotherapy group had the op-\n\ntion of receiving nivolumab at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram every 2 weeks until further disease progression, and patients in the combination group were required to discontinue treatment (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org).\n\nThe primary end point was the rate of investigator-assessed, confirmed objective response among patients with *BRAF* V600 wild-type tumors. The primary end point was restricted to this group of patients because at the time of study enrollment, approved treatment options were limited for these patients and only ipilimumab had shown an overall survival benefit in a randomized, controlled trial. Secondary end points included investigator-assessed progression-free survival in patients with *BRAF* wild-type tumors, the objective response rate and progression-free survival among patients with *BRAF* V600 mutation\u2013positive tumors, and safety.\n\n#### **Assessments**\n\nTumor response was assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1,18 at the following time points: 12 weeks after the first treatment, every 6 weeks thereafter for the first year, then every 12 weeks until disease progression or discontinuation of treatment. Safety evaluations were performed in patients who had received at least one dose of study treatment, and the severity of adverse events was graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0.19 Guidelines for the management of adverse events were provided by the sponsor and are available in the Supplementary Appendix.\n\n#### **Study Oversight**\n\nThe study protocol, available along with the most recent version of the statistical analysis plan at NEJM.org, was approved by the institutional review board at each participating center. The study was conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki and International Conference on Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. All the patients provided written informed consent. An independent radiology review committee was established to provide a sensitivity assessment of objective responses, and a data and safety monitoring committee provided general oversight. Data were collected by the sponsor, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and were analyzed in collaboration with the authors. The authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and the fidelity of the study to the protocol. The first draft of the manuscript was written by the first and last authors, with all the authors contributing to subsequent drafts. Medical-writing support, funded by the sponsor, was provided by StemScientific. All the authors made the decision to submit the manuscript for publication.\n\n#### **Immunohistochemical Assessment of PD-L1**\n\nThe expression of PD-L1 on the surface of tumor cells was assessed in pretreatment tumor samples at a central laboratory with the use of an automated immunohistochemical assay (Bristol-Myers Squibb and Dako), as described previously.17 A tumor was considered to be PD-L1\u2013positive if at least 5% of tumor cells showed cell-surface PD-L1 staining of any intensity in a section containing at least 100 tumor cells that could be evaluated.\n\n#### **Statistical Analysis**\n\nWe planned to enroll approximately 100 patients with *BRAF* V600 wild-type tumors who would be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to one of the two treatment groups (the intention-to-treat population). Patients with *BRAF* V600 mutation\u2013positive tumors were eligible for the study, with approximately 50 planned to undergo randomization. Analyses in the population with *BRAF* V600 mutation\u2013positive tumors were intended to be descriptive only and were not part of the sample-size consideration. Given a two-sided alpha level of 0.05, we calculated that the sample of 100 patients with *BRAF* wild-type tumors would give the study approximately 87% power to detect a significant difference in the objective response rate between the combination group and the ipilimumab-monotherapy group, assuming an objective response rate of 40% versus 10%. In order to preserve an experiment-wide type I error rate of 5%, a hierarchical testing approach was applied to key secondary end points after analysis of the primary end point of the objective response rate in all patients with *BRAF* wild-type tumors who underwent randomization. Of the key secondary end points, the objective response rate among all randomly assigned patients was tested first, followed by testing of progression-free survival among all patients with *BRAF* wild-type tumors who under-\n\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\n\nDownloaded from nejm.org at Chalmers Tekniska Hogskola on June 16, 2025.

At trial entry, the majority of patients (87%) had stage IV disease according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system, and 46% of the patients had tumors characterized as M1c disease (metastases to visceral sites other than skin, subcutaneous, distant lymph nodes, or lung, or distant metastases to any site along with elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase level). Elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels were observed in 35 patients (25%), and 23% of the patients had *BRAF* V600 mutation\u2013positive tumors. Of 118 patients whose PD-L1 expression could be evaluated, 35 (30%) had PD-L1\u2013positive tumors.\n\nFrom September 16, 2013, to February 6, 2014, a total of 179 patients were screened in the United States and France, and 142 patients (109 with *BRAF* wild-type tumors and 33 with *BRAF* V600 mutation\u2013positive tumors) were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Clinical database lock for the results reported here occurred on January 30, 2015, with a minimum follow-up period of 11 months after randomization.\n\n#### **Efficacy**\n\nThe rate of investigator-assessed, confirmed objective response among the patients with *BRAF* wild-type tumors was 61% (95% confidence interval [CI], 49 to 72) in the combination group, versus 11% (95% CI, 3 to 25) in the ipilimumabmonotherapy group (odds ratio, 12.96; 95% CI, 3.91 to 54.49; P<0.001) (Table 2). A complete response was observed in 16 patients (22%) in the combination group and no patients in the ipilimumab-monotherapy group. Figure 1A shows the distribution of tumor-burden change from baseline among patients with *BRAF* wild-type tumors. The median change in investigator-assessed tumor volume was a 68.1% decrease in the combination group and a 5.5% increase in the ipilimumab-monotherapy group.\n\nAmong the patients with *BRAF* wild-type tumors who underwent randomization, the median duration of response was not reached in either group, with an ongoing response observed in 36 of the 44 patients with a response (82%) in the combination group and in 3 of the 4 patients with a response (75%) in the ipilimumab-monotherapy group (Fig. 1B). The time to a response did not differ significantly between the groups, with the majority of all responses observed at the time the first scan was obtained (Fig. 1B).\n\nAmong patients with *BRAF* mutation\u2013positive tumors, the objective response rate was 52% (12 of 23 patients) in the combination group, with the percentage of complete responses (22% [5 patients]) similar to that in patients with *BRAF* wildtype tumors (Table 2). In the population with *BRAF* wild-type tumors, the median progressionfree survival was not reached with the combination therapy and was 4.4 months (95% CI, 2.8 to 5.7) with ipilimumab monotherapy (hazard ratio associated with combination therapy as compared with ipilimumab monotherapy for disease progression or death, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.68; P<0.001) (Fig. 1C). Among patients with *BRAF* mutation\u2013positive tumors, the median progression-free survival was 8.5 months (95% CI, 2.8 to not estimable) in the combination group and 2.7 months (95% CI, 1.0 to 5.4) in the ipilimumabmonotherapy group (hazard ratio associated with combination therapy as compared with ipilimumab monotherapy for disease progression or death, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.15 to 1.00) (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Among all randomly assigned patients who discontinued study treatment owing to toxic effects, the objective response rate was 68% (95% CI, 52 to 81) in the combination group (30 of 44 patients), as compared with 10% (95% CI, 0 to 45) in the ipilimumab-monotherapy group (1 of 10 patients).\n\nIn patients with *BRAF* wild-type tumors, the response benefit with the nivolumab-and-ipilimumab combination, as compared with ipilimumab alone, was observed across all prespecified patient subgroups, including patients with stage M1c disease and those with elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). In the combination group, the objective response rate was independent of tumor PD-L1 status: 58% (95% CI, 37 to 78) among patients with PD-L1\u2013positive tumors and 55% (95% CI, 41 to 69) among patients with PD-L1\u2013negative tumors (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).

The calculation of the confidence interval (CI) was based on the Clopper\u2013Pearson method. The estimated odds ratio for nivolumab plus ipilimumab as compared with ipilimumab alone was 12.96 (95% CI, 3.91 to 54.49) among patients with *BRAF* wild-type tumors (P<0.001) and 9.82 (95% CI, 0.99 to 465.39) among patients with *BRAF* V600 mutation\u2013positive tumors (P value was not calculated, per the statistical analysis plan).\n\nsponse rate was observed among patients with PD-L1\u2013positive tumors than among patients with PD-L1\u2013negative tumors (18% [95% CI, 2 to 52] vs. 4% [95% CI, 0 to 19]).\n\n#### **Safety**\n\nIn the combination group, 59% and 57% of the patients received at least four doses of nivolumab and ipilimumab, respectively; in the ipilimumab monotherapy group, 70% of the patients received at least four doses of ipilimumab (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The rate of treatmentrelated adverse events, as assessed by the investigators, was 91% in the combination group and 93% in the ipilimumab-monotherapy group (Table 3). Drug-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were reported more frequently in the combination group than in the ipilimumab-monotherapy group (54% vs. 24%); in patients who received the combination regimen, the onset of most adverse events occurred during the combination phase rather than the maintenance (nivolumab-monotherapy) phase. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events associated with the combination therapy were colitis (17%), diarrhea (11%), and an elevated alanine aminotransferase level (11%). Diarrhea was the most frequently reported grade 3 or 4 adverse event associated with ipilimumab monotherapy (11%), followed by colitis (7%).\n\nSelect adverse events of potentially immune-\n\nmediated cause occurred most frequently in the skin, gastrointestinal, endocrine, and hepatic organ categories (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix) and were observed more frequently with combination therapy than with ipilimumab monotherapy. Immunosuppressive medications for the management of adverse events, including topical agents for dermatologic adverse events, were used in a higher percentage of patients in the combination group than in the ipilimumab group (89% vs. 59%). The most commonly used systemic immunosuppressive agents across both treatment groups were glucocorticoids (82% of the patients in the combination group and 50% of the patients in the ipilimumab-monotherapy group). Infliximab was administered to 13% and 9% of the patients in the respective groups for adverse-event management. Hormone-replacement therapy was used to manage endocrine adverse events. Of 46 grade 3 or 4 drug-related select adverse events in the combination group that were managed with immunomodulatory medication, the majority (approximately 80%) resolved completely, or symptoms returned to baseline levels (Table 4). There was a similar resolution rate across organ categories in both treatment groups.\n\nThe most common reason for discontinuation of study treatment was drug-related adverse events in the combination group (45%) and disease progression in the ipilimumab-monothera-\n\nn engl j med 372;21 nejm.org may 21, 2015 2011\n\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.

Change in Tumor Burden, Durability of Tumor Regressions, and Progression-free Survival.**\n\nPanel A shows the best change from baseline in the sum of the reference diameters of the target lesion in patients receiving the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab (left) and those receiving ipilimumab monotherapy (right). The dashed line indicates the 30% reduction in tumor burden that is consistent with a response to treatment according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1. Panel B shows the durability of tumor regressions in patients with advanced melanoma with *BRAF* wildtype tumors who had objective responses to the combination regimen or ipilimumab monotherapy according to conventional RECIST guidelines. Open circles indicate the first evidence of objective response and arrows indicate an ongoing response at the time of the analysis.

After the initial four doses, 40% of the patients in the combination group continued to receive nivolumab as monotherapy (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).\n\nThe number of reported deaths among treated patients was 25 in the combination group (27%) and 17 in the ipilimumab-monotherapy group (37%); most deaths were due to progressive disease. Three deaths were related to the combination therapy according to investigator assessment \u2014 one patient with a history of cardiac disease died from ventricular arrhythmia 29 days after the last dose of study treatment; the second died suddenly 69 days after the last dose while clinically improving from pneumonitis and having an iatrogenic pneumothorax. The third patient died suddenly 86 days after the last dose of study treatment (3 days after the resolution of grade 3 pneumonia and grade 4 hypercalcemia). None of the deaths in the ipilimumabmonotherapy group were deemed to be related to the study drug.\n\n## Discussion\n\nIn this double-blind, randomized study, the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab resulted in a significantly higher objective response rate, more frequent complete responses, and significantly longer progression-free survival than ipilimumab alone among previously untreated patients with advanced melanoma. The confirmed response rate associated with the combination therapy in this trial (61%) is numerically higher than the 40% response rate that was recently reported with nivolumab monotherapy as first-line therapy in patients with advanced melanoma who have *BRAF* wild-type tumors and also higher than the rate observed in trials of monotherapy with pembrolizumab, another anti\u2013PD-1 agent.<sup>20</sup> However, it is inherently difficult to compare the efficacy of the combination therapy with that of anti\u2013PD-1 monotherapy, because the demographic characteristics of the patients differed among the trials.\n\nOn the basis of the high degree of tumor reduction in the current study, with a high rate of complete responses (22% among the patients with *BRAF* wild-type tumors who were assigned to the combination therapy), a favorable clinical benefit can be anticipated with longer follow-up. Overall, the characteristics of response observed with nivolumab plus ipilimumab in the current study are consistent with results reported previously,16,17 with most responses occurring by the time of the first tumor assessment and, in many patients, responses continuing despite discontinuation of therapy. The response rate associated with the combination regimen in this current phase 2 study was even higher than response rates reported previously, which may be explained by the fact that the patient population in this study was previously untreated. A prior phase 1 trial of the combination regimen at varying doses showed high rates of overall survival at 1 year (85%) and 2 years (79%).16,17\n\nThe primary end point of this study specifically addressed patients with *BRAF* wild-type melanoma because at the time of study enrollment, ipilimumab was the only approved therapy for this group of patients that had shown an overall survival benefit in a randomized phase 3 trial. Although BRAF inhibitors as single agents and BRAF inhibitor\u2013MEK inhibitor combinations can result in high response rates among patients with *BRAF*-mutant melanoma,14,15,21 no\n\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.

the first dose of study treatment and within 100 days after the last dose of study treatment.\n\n\u2020 Shown are events that were reported in at least 10% of the patients in either study group.\n\n\u2021 Diarrhea was defined as a disorder characterized by frequent and watery bowel movements; colitis was defined as a disorder characterized by inflammation of the colon. Grade 3 or 4 drug-related adverse events were reported more frequently in the combination group than in the ipilimumab-monotherapy group; in patients who received the combination regimen, most adverse events had first onset during the combination phase rather than the maintenance (nivolumab-monotherapy) phase.\n\n\u00a7 One additional patient in the ipilimumab-monotherapy group had progressive disease on April 28, 2014, and data were unblinded before the patient started nivolumab monotherapy a day later. This patient received 10 cycles of nivolumab monotherapy before the onset of pneumonitis after the last dose on September 25, 2014.\n\nsingle agent or combination of agents has similarly been shown to result in a high response rate among patients with *BRAF* wild-type melanoma. Nevertheless, among patients with *BRAF*mutant melanoma, the overall response rate and progression-free survival associated with the combination regimen were also substantially higher than those with ipilimumab alone. These results are consistent with the results of a previous phase 1 trial and suggest that the presence of the *BRAF* V600 mutation does not influence the efficacy of checkpoint blockade.16,17,22\n\nIn general, the spectrum of select adverse events that we observed was consistent with previous experience with the combination therapy.16 Three deaths related to the combination regimen were reported in this study; these deaths could be linked to preexisting conditions that were related to the cause of death or that required medical procedures that might have contributed to the death. The proportion of patients who had a grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse event was higher with the nivolumaband-ipilimumab combination than with ipilimumab monotherapy (54% vs. 24%). Select grade 3 or 4 adverse events generally occurred within the first 15 weeks of treatment with the combination regimen and typically required less than 9 weeks to resolve, depending on the specific adverse event. Aside from patients with endocrinopathies, which typically require continued hormone-replacement therapy, the majority of patients\n\n| Table 4.

These data suggest that PD-L1 should not be used to select patients to receive combination treatment. The mechanism for response independent of baseline PD-L1 status remains unclear. It is possible that ipilimumab drives T cells into the tumor and that this T-cell infiltration during treatment leads to a more favorable microenvironment for anti\u2013PD-1 efficacy.25,26 It is also possible that assessment of PD-L1 status with the incorporation of PD-L1\u2013expressing tumor-infiltrating macrophages or T cells (rather than tumor cells, as in our study) may be most relevant, but this possibility requires additional investigation.\n\nIn summary, the combination of ipilimumab plus nivolumab resulted in durable responses and\n\n#### **References**\n\n**2.** Robert C, Thomas L, Bondarenko I, et al.

We report a phase 3 trial comparing the benefit\u2013risk profile of ipilimumab 10 mg/kg versus 3 mg/kg.**\n\n**Methods This randomised, double-blind, multicentre, phase 3 trial was done in 87 centres in 21 countries worldwide. Patients with untreated or previously treated unresectable stage III or IV melanoma, without previous treatment with BRAF inhibitors or immune checkpoint inhibitors, were randomly assigned (1:1) with an interactive voice response system by the permuted block method using block size 4 to ipilimumab 10 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg, administered by intravenous infusion for 90 min every 3 weeks for four doses. Patients were stratified by metastasis stage, previous treatment for metastatic melanoma, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status. The patients, investigators, and site staff were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population and safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This study is completed and was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01515189.**\n\n**Findings Between Feb 29, and July 9, 2012, 727 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to ipilimumab 10 mg/kg (365 patients; 364 treated) or ipilimumab 3 mg/kg (362 patients; all treated). Median follow-up was 14\u00b75 months (IQR 4\u00b76\u201342\u00b73) for the ipilimumab 10 mg/kg group and 11\u00b72 months (4\u00b79\u201329\u00b74) for the ipilimumab 3 mg/kg group. Median overall survival was 15\u00b77 months (95% CI 11\u00b76\u201317\u00b78) for ipilimumab 10 mg/kg compared with 11\u00b75 months (9\u00b79\u201313\u00b73) for ipilimumab 3 mg/kg (hazard ratio 0\u00b784, 95% CI 0\u00b770\u20130\u00b799; p=0\u00b704). The most common grade 3\u20134 treatment-related adverse events were diarrhoea (37 [10%] of 364 patients in the 10 mg/kg group** *vs* **21 [6%] of 362 patients in the 3 mg/kg group), colitis (19 [5%]** *vs* **nine [2%]), increased alanine aminotransferase (12 [3%]** *vs* **two [1%]), and hypophysitis (ten [3%]** *vs* **seven [2%]). Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 133 (37%) patients in the 10 mg/kg group and 66 (18%) patients in the 3 mg/kg group; four (1%) versus two (<1%) patients died from treatment-related adverse events.**\n\n**Interpretation In patients with advanced melanoma, ipilimumab 10 mg/kg resulted in significantly longer overall survival than did ipilimumab 3 mg/kg, but with increased treatment-related adverse events. Although the treatment landscape for advanced melanoma has changed since this study was initiated, the clinical use of ipilimumab in refractory patients with unmet medical needs could warrant further assessment.**\n\n**Funding Bristol-Myers Squibb.**\n\n# **Introduction**\n\nThe enhancement of antitumour immunity through blockade of immune checkpoint molecules has led to a substantial survival advantage in patients with metastatic melanoma compared with patients given previously available treatments. Ipilimumab is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody designed to block CTLA-4.1 Ipilimumab was the first therapy to show an improvement in overall survival of patients with metastatic melanoma in a randomised, controlled phase 3 trial. It has a manageable safety profile as monotherapy at both 3 mg/kg in previously treated patients2 and 10 mg/kg in combination with dacarbazine in treatment-naive patients.3 A 5-year survival benefit has been seen with ipilimumab 10 mg/kg plus dacarbazine in a phase 3 trial.4 Additionally, a pooled analysis of prospective and retrospective trials in patients with advanced melanoma who were followed up for 10 years, which includes this 5-year dacarbazine trial, showed durable long-term survival in more than 20% of patients, with a plateau around year 3.5 Ipilimumab at a dose of 3 mg/kg is approved in several countries for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma and a dose of 10 mg/kg is approved in the USA as an adjuvant treatment for resected stage III melanoma.\n\n#### *Lancet Oncol* **2017; 18: 611\u201322**\n\nPublished**Online** March 27, 2017 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/ S1470-2045(17)30231-0\n\nSee **Comment** page 558 **Istituto Nazionale Tumori Fondazione Pascale, Naples, Italy** (P A Ascierto MD)**; Medical Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Milan, Italy** (M Del Vecchio MD)**; Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus Grand Paris, Villejuif, France** (Prof C Robert MD)**; Department of Diagnostics and Cancer Immunology, Greater Poland Cancer Centre, Poznan Medical University, Poznan, Poland** (Prof A Mackiewicz MD)**; IOV-IRCCS, Melanoma Oncology Unit, Padova, Italy** (V Chiarion-Sileni MD)**; Hospital Clinic and Institut d\u00b4Investigacions Biom\u00e8diques August Pi I Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain** (A Arance MD)**; AP-HP Dermatology CIC Departments, Saint-Louis Hospital, INSERM U976, Universit\u00e9 Paris Diderot, Paris, France** (Prof C Lebb\u00e9 MD)**; Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark** (L Bastholt MD)**; The Angeles Clinic and Research Institute, Los Angeles, CA, USA** (O Hamid MD)**; Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center, Warsaw, Poland** (Prof P Rutkowski MD)**; Chris O'Brien Lifehouse and Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Camperdown, NSW, Australia (C McNeil MD), Melanoma Institute Australia, Sydney, NSW, Australia** (C McNeil)**; Eberhard Karls University, T\u00fcbingen, Germany** (Prof C Garbe MD)**; University Medical Center, Mainz, Germany** (C Loquai MD)**; Department of Oncodermatology, INSERM** \n\n![](_page_0_Picture_16.jpeg)\n\n**Research Unit 892, Nantes University Hospital, Nantes, France** (Prof B Dreno MD)**; Department of Dermatology, Centre Hospitalier Lyon-Sud, Pierre-B\u00e9nite, France** (Prof L Thomas MD)**; Hospital de la Timone, Marseille, France** (Prof J-J Grob MD)**; National Institute of Oncology, Budapest, Hungary** (Prof G Liszkay)**; Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway**  (M Nyakas MD)**; Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Hannover, Germany** (Prof R Gutzmer MD)**; Wojewodzkie Centrum Oncologii, Gda\u0144sk, Poland** (J Pikiel MD)**; Department of Dermatology, Reims University Hospital, Reims, France** (F Grange MD**); Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria** (C Hoeller MD)**; Istituti Fisioterapici Ospitalieri, Rome, Italy** (V Ferraresi MD)**; Cross Cancer Institute, Edmonton, AB, Canada** (M Smylie MD)**; University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany** (Prof D Schadendorf MD)**; H\u00f4spital Claude Huriez, Lille, France** (Prof L Mortier MD)**; Herlev Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Herlev, Denmark** (I M Svane MD)**; Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ, USA** (D Hennicken MSc, A Qureshi MD)**; and University Hospital of Siena, Istituto Toscano Tumori, Siena, Italy** (M Maio MD)\n\nCorrespondence to: Dr Paolo A Ascierto, Melanoma Cancer Immunotherapy and Innovative Therapy Unit, Istituto Nazionale Tumori Fondazione \"G. Pascale\", Via Mariano Semmola, Naples 80131, Italy **paolo.ascierto@gmail.com**\n\nSee **Online** for appendix\n\n## **Research in context**\n\n## **Evidence before this study**\n\nTo identify other studies of ipilimumab in melanoma, we searched PubMed and congress abstracts from the annual meetings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the European Society for Medical Oncology, and the Society for Melanoma Research for articles published in English between Jan 1, 2010, and July 31, 2016. Our search terms included \"ipilimumab\", \"anti-CTLA-4\", \"BMS-734016\", \"MDX-010\", and \"MDX-101\". We focused on survival results in melanoma. Ipilimumab was the first drug to show a survival improvement in patients with metastatic melanoma in a randomised controlled phase 3 trial. Together, efficacy data across phase 2 and phase 3 studies show an overall survival benefit for both 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg doses of ipilimumab compared with controls. Additional data from a dose-ranging phase 2 study suggest longer survival with the 10 mg/kg dose than with lower doses. No studies done so far permit conclusive comparison of ipilimumab 10 mg/kg with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg.\n\n## **Added value of this study**\n\nWhen the two doses of ipilimumab were directly compared in this study, overall survival was significantly improved with the\n\nA randomised, phase 2, dose-ranging study of ipilimumab at 0\u00b73 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg in patients with previously treated metastatic melanoma reported an improvement in best overall response with an increased ipilimumab dose, although with a higher frequency of immune-related adverse events.6 The study was not designed to detect statistical differences in survival between the groups, but reported an improved median overall survival and 1-year overall survival at 10 mg/kg compared with lower doses, although crossover to 10 mg/kg was permitted for the lower doses.\n\nTogether, efficacy data across phase 2 and phase 3 studies show increased overall survival for patients treated with either 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg doses of ipilimumab compared with controls. However, no studies done so far permit conclusive comparison of these two doses. To further investigate the benefit of higher-dose ipilimumab in stage III unresectable or stage IV melanoma, we report survival outcomes from a comparison of ipilimumab 10 mg/kg with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg in a phase 3 trial.\n\n# **Methods**\n\n## **Study design and patients**\n\nThis was a randomised, double-blind, multicentre, phase 3 study done in 87 centres in 21 countries worldwide (appendix pp 13\u201314), with the largest proportion of participants from Europe. Eligible patients had treated or untreated histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable stage III or IV melanoma (advanced melanoma) and no previous therapy with BRAF inhibitors, CTLA-4 or PD-1 antagonists, or PD-L1 or CD137 agonists. 10 mg/kg dose compared with the 3 mg/kg dose, whereas the 3 mg/kg dose had a more favourable safety profile and a survival benefit consistent with that seen in other ipilimumab 3 mg/kg studies in advanced melanoma. Quality of life generally worsened during the ipilimumab induction phase treatment, and this worsening seemed to be more pronounced with 10 mg/kg compared with 3 mg/kg. However, insufficient duration of follow-up prevents conclusions to be drawn regarding the long-term effect of ipilimumab on quality of life.\n\n## **Implications of all the available evidence**\n\nThe treatment landscape for first-line treatment of patients with advanced melanoma has changed since this study was initiated, with ipilimumab being succeeded by newer treatments. However, the increased survival benefit of ipilimumab 10 mg/kg compared with 3 mg/kg suggests that the clinical utility of ipilimumab in refractory patients with high unmet medical need could warrant further assessment.\n\nOther melanoma treatments were permitted with a washout period of 4 weeks for all previous anticancer therapy and at least 2 years for systemic immunosuppressive drugs, except for episodic low-dose corticosteroids. Disease progression was based on recommendation of the enrolling physician. Other eligibility criteria included an age of at least 18 years, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 or 1, and measurable disease based on modified WHO criteria within 28 days of first dose. Laboratory testing required for study entry included baseline DNA samples from peripheral blood for testing of CD86 and CTLA-4 polymorphisms and genome-wide association analysis for immune-related adverse events, and testing for adequate haematological, renal, and hepatic function. Key exclusion criteria were the presence of brain metastases with symptoms or requiring treatment; a diagnosis of primary ocular melanoma; a history of autoimmune disease; uncontrolled infectious disease, any immunodeficiency disease, splenectomy, or splenic irradiation; or previous allogeneic stem cell transplantation.\n\nThe study protocol and the statistical analysis plan are available in the appendix. The institutional review board at each study site approved the study protocol. The study was done in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, as defined by the International Conference on Harmonisation and in accordance with the ethical principles underlying European Union Directive 2001/20/EC and the United States Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 50. All patients provided informed written consent.\n\n## **Randomisation and masking**\n\nPatients were randomly assigned (1:1) to treatment with ipilimumab at a dose of 10 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg by use of an interactive voice response system. To be enrolled in the system, the following information was required: date of birth, date of signed informed consent, sex**,** metastasis (M) substage, yes or no for previous treatment of metastatic melanoma, and ECOG performance status. Randomisation was done by the permutated block method using block size 4 and was stratified by M substage (M0/ M1a/M1b *vs* M1c without brain metastases *vs* M1c with brain metastases), previous treatment for metastatic melanoma (yes *vs* no), and ECOG performance status (0 *vs* 1). After completion of all screening evaluations, an unmasked pharmacist called the interactive voice response system to obtain treatment assignment and an unmasked site monitor provided oversight of drug supply and other unmasked study documentation. The funder, patients, investigators, and site staff remained masked to treatment assignment. An independent data monitoring committee was unmasked to review emerging safety data.\n\n## **Procedures**\n\nIn both 10 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg dose groups, ipilimumab was administered by intravenous infusion for 90 min every 3 weeks for four doses. Treatment was continued for a maximum of four doses during the initial treatment phase until confirmed progression defined by immunerelated response criteria,7,8 unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. In the absence of intolerable toxicity, patients who had stable disease for 3 months or more, or a partial or complete response after the last dose, and then progressed per immune-related response criteria, were eligible for retreatment with the study drug per the original randomisation and dose scheme. We assessed all response-based endpoints using modified WHO criteria, consistent with previous ipilimumab studies.2,3 Tumour response was based on investigator assessment, which was done during the initial treatment phase at screening, at weeks 12, 16, and 24, and every 12 weeks thereafter, and was done for confirmation of response and progression, including new lesions. However, because ipilimumab can induce responses that occur after initial tumour volume increase or appearance of new lesions, discontinuation criteria were based on immune-related response criteria that address unconventional response patterns to ensure patients were not prematurely discontinued.7,8\n\nWe did safety evaluations in patients who had received at least one dose of study treatment, and graded severity of adverse events according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0.9 The funder provided guidelines for management of adverse events, which have been published.10\u201312 We did not allow crossover or reduction of ipilimumab dose. Study dose could be delayed for nonskin-related, treatment-related adverse events that were higher than grade 2; grade 3 or higher laboratory abnormality; skin-related, any-cause adverse events that were grade 3 or higher; or an adverse event warranting delay by the judgment of the investigator. Laboratory monitoring included haematology, chemistry, C-reactive protein, endocrine, and pharmacokinetic or anti-drug antibody testing, and occurred at weeks 1, 4, 7, 10, 12, and 24 and at the end-of-treatment visit, except for endocrine testing, which occurred at weeks 1, 4, 7, 10, and 12. *BRAF* mutation testing was done locally per local regulations and standards.\n\nWe collected health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) questionnaire data, as available, in all patients randomly assigned, at weeks 1, 4, 7, 10, and 12, and at the end-oftreatment visit. Assessment of HRQoL was done at each site with the appropriately translated and validated version\n\n![](_page_2_Figure_8.jpeg)\n\n*Figure 1:* **Trial profile**\n\n|                                 | Ipilimumab<br>10 mg/kg<br>(n=365) | Ipilimumab<br>3 mg/kg<br>(n=362) |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Age (years)                     | 62 (49\u201370)                        | 62 (51\u201371)                       |\n| <65                             | 224 (61%)                         | 208 (57%)                        |\n| \u226565                             | 141 (39%)                         | 154 (43%)                        |\n| Sex                             |                                   |                                  |\n| Male                            | 219 (60%)                         | 231 (64%)                        |\n| Female                          | 146 (40%)                         | 131 (36%)                        |\n| Race                            |                                   |                                  |\n| White                           | 361 (99%)                         | 359 (99%)                        |\n| Black or African American       | 1 (<1%)                           | 1 (<1%)                          |\n| Asian                           | 2 (1%)                            | 1 (<1%)                          |\n| Other                           | 1 (<1%)                           | 1 (<1%)                          |\n| ECOG PS                         |                                   |                                  |\n| 0                               | 262 (72%)                         | 253 (70%)                        |\n| 1                               | 103 (28%)                         | 109 (30%)                        |\n| M stage                         |                                   |                                  |\n| M0, M1a, or M1b                 | 136 (37%)                         | 142 (39%)                        |\n| M1c without brain metastases    | 164 (45%)                         | 158 (44%)                        |\n| M1c with brain metastases       | 65 (18%)                          | 62 (17%)                         |\n| Previous treatment for melanoma |                                   |                                  |\n| Yes                             | 205 (56%)                         | 205 (57%)                        |\n| No                              | 160 (44%)                         | 157 (43%)                        |\n| Previous therapy                |                                   |                                  |\n| Any previous systemic therapy*  | 206\u2020 (56%)                        | 205 (57%)                        |\n| Any previous radiotherapy       | 107 (29%)                         | 96 (27%)                         |\n| Any previous surgery            | 359 (98%)                         | 346 (96%)                        |\n| Lactate dehydrogenase           |                                   |                                  |\n| \u2264ULN                            | 222 (61%)                         | 219 (60%)                        |\n| >ULN                            | 133 (36%)                         | 136 (38%)                        |\n| \u22642 \u00d7ULN                         | 321 (88%)                         | 306 (85%)                        |\n| >2 \u00d7ULN                         | 34 (9%)                           | 49 (14%)                         |\n| Not reported                    | 10 (3%)                           | 7 (2%)                           |\n| AJCC disease stage              |                                   |                                  |\n| III                             | 35 (10%)                          | 35 (10%)                         |\n| IV                              | 330 (90%)                         | 327 (90%)                        |\n| BRAF status                     |                                   |                                  |\n| Mutation, V600                  | 75 (21%)                          | 75 (21%)                         |\n| Mutation, other                 | 5 (1%)                            | 4 (1%)                           |\n| No mutation<br>Unknown          | 225 (62%)<br>60 (16%)             | 237 (65%)<br>46 (13%)            |\n|                                 |                                   |                                  |\n\nData are median (IQR) or n (%).

Assessments were done using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 questionnaire version 313 and the European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) summary index and visual analogue scale (VAS).14\n\nEORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item, self-administered, multidimensional, cancer-specific HRQoL patientreported outcome questionnaire.13 A difference of 10 points on a 100-point scale was regarded as clinically significant, as is common in clinical trials in which sample size is not based on the HRQoL endpoint.15\n\nThe EQ-5D is a standardised measure of health status developed by the EuroQoL Group and provides a generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal.14 The EQ-5D consists of a descriptive system comprising the five dimensions of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression, and the EQ-5D VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a vertical VAS. Score differences of 0\u00b708 for the EQ-5D utility index score and 7 for the EQ-5D VAS were regarded as clinically significant.16\n\n## **Outcomes**\n\nOverall survival was the primary endpoint, defined as the time between randomisation date and death, assessed at a minimum of every 12 weeks, censored at the last date the participant was known to be alive.\n\nSecondary endpoints were progression-free survival defined as the time between randomisation date and the date of progression or death, whichever occurred first; objective response and disease control as per modified WHO criteria; duration of response and stable disease by modified WHO criteria; overall survival on a yearly basis for up to 5 years; and overall survival in the subset of patients with asymptomatic brain metastases. Additional secondary endpoints were evaluation of safety for both dose groups and HRQoL.\n\n## **Statistical analysis**\n\nA study sample of 700 patients was planned for the primary endpoint of overall survival to obtain the 540 events necessary to detect an overall hazard ratio (HR) of 0*\u00b7*744 between the two randomised groups using a two-sided, log-rank test with an experiment-wise type I error of 0*\u00b7*05 with at least 90% power. An interim analysis for overall survival was originally planned at about 67% (360 deaths) of the total events. However, as a result of the faster than expected enrolment of less than 5 months, the projected interim analysis would have had a followup period of less than 18 months. Therefore, the protocol was amended on June 24, 2013, to remove the interim analysis and wait for the planned final analysis with a survival follow-up of at least 2 years.\n\nFor the primary endpoint (overall survival) and secondary endpoint (progression-free survival), a logrank test compared randomised groups according to stratification factors, with HR and its associated 95% CI estimated using a stratified Cox model with randomised group as the only covariate. In both analyses, we estimated the event-free survival probabilities with the Kaplan-Meier\n\n**Articles**\n\n![](_page_4_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\n*Figure 2:* **Overall survival and progression-free survival** (A) Overall survival in the intention-to-treat population.

Additionally, we did subgroup analyses for overall survival including the prespecified subgroups of age, race, sex, M stage, ECOG performance status, previous treatment for melanoma, and baseline lactate dehydrogenase, as well as *BRAF* mutation status, which, although not a prespecified subgroup in the protocol, was generated before database lock. We analysed descriptive statistics for HRQoL endpoints at baseline for all patients with baseline measurements, and for change from baseline for all patients with both baseline and on-study assessment for a particular timepoint; mean change from baseline and 95% CI for each timepoint were plotted for each scale.\n\n> To preserve a type I error rate of 5%, a hierarchical testing approach was applied in the following order: overall survival, progression-free survival, objective response, and disease control.

We did safety assessments for all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. In general, missing values were not imputed, except for EORTC QLQ-C30, in which missing values for missing items were imputed by assuming that the missing items had values equal to the average of the items that were present for any scale in which at least half of the items were completed (method from the scoring manual). Irrespective of missing data, all participants contributed to the calculation of the following tumour response endpoints: best overall response or disease control (by inclusion in the denominators), and the Kaplan-Meier analyses of duration of response, duration of stable disease, and progression-free survival (by censoring, as appropriate). A data and safety monitoring committee was established to provide general oversight. All statistical analyses were done with SAS version 9.3 and 9.4.\n\nThis study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01515189.\n\n## **Role of the funding source**\n\nThis study was designed by the funder. Data were collected by the investigators and analysed by the funder in collaboration with all authors. Data were interpreted jointly by the funder and the authors. Writing and editorial support were funded by the funder of the study. All authors had access to the data and the corresponding author had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\n\n# **Results**\n\nBetween Feb 29, and July 9, 2012, we enrolled 831 patients. 727 patients were randomly assigned to treatment and included in the intention-to-treat population for efficacy: 365 to the 10 mg/kg group and 362 to the 3 mg/kg group (figure 1). One patient in the 10 mg/kg group was not treated due to an adverse event and therefore the safety analysis consisted of 364 patients for the 10 mg/kg group and 362 patients for the 3 mg/kg group. Baseline characteristics were balanced between the two dose groups (table 1). Baseline characteristics were also generally balanced between the 80 (22%) patients in the 10 mg/kg group and the 79 (22%) patients in the 3 mg/kg group with *BRAF* mutation-positive tumours (appendix p 2).\n\nThe database lock occurred on March 18, 2016, after trial completion. At a minimum follow-up of 43 months, the median number of doses of ipilimumab received per patient in the initial treatment phase was 4\u00b70 (IQR 3\u00b70\u20134\u00b70) in the 10 mg/kg group, with 212 (58%) of 364 patients completing all four doses, and 4\u00b70 ( 3\u00b70\u20134\u00b70) in the 3 mg/kg group, with 241 (67%) of 362 patients completing all four doses. At database lock, 23 (6%) of 364 patients in the 10 mg/kg group and 32 (9%) of 362 patients in the 3 mg/kg group entered the first retreatment phase. In the initial treatment phase, the most common reason for discontinuation in both groups was disease progression, followed by treatment-related adverse events. Discontinuation due to disease progression was lower in the 10 mg/kg group (109 [30%] of 364 patients) than in the 3 mg/kg group (155 [43%] of 362 patients), whereas discontinuation due to treatmentrelated adverse events was higher in the 10 mg/kg group (86 [24%] of 364 patients) than in the 3 mg/kg group (36 [10%] of 362 patients; figure 1, appendix p 3).\n\nSubsequent systemic therapy was received by 131 (36%) of 365 patients in the 10 mg/kg group (including subsequent immunotherapy in 57 [16%] and subsequent targeted therapy in 37 [10%]) and by 136 (38%) of 362 patients in the 3 mg/kg group (including subsequent immunotherapy in 51 [14%] patients and subsequent targeted therapy in 47 [13%]; appendix p 4). A similar proportion of patients with *BRAF* mutation-positive tumours received subsequent therapy in both dose groups (43 [54%] of 80 patients in the 10 mg/kg group *vs* 47 [59%] of 79 patients in the 3 mg/kg group), although more patients in the 10 mg/kg group than in the 3 mg/kg group received subsequent anti-PD-1 therapy (15 [19%] *vs* eight [10%]; appendix p 5). Median time from randomisation to first subsequent therapy was 216 days (IQR 141\u2013371) for the 10 mg/kg group and 190 days (134\u2013360) for the 3 mg/kg group.\n\nFor overall survival, median follow-up was 14\u00b75 months (IQR 4\u00b76\u201342\u00b73) for the 10 mg/kg group and 11\u00b72 months\n\n|                                          | Ipilimumab 10 mg/kg (n=364) |          |

|\n\n(4\u00b79\u201329\u00b74) for the 3 mg/kg group. In the intention-to-treat population, 541 patients died during the study (262 [72%] of 365 patients in the 10 mg/kg group *vs* 279 [77%] of 362 in the 3 mg/kg group). Median overall survival was 15\u00b77 months (95% CI 11\u00b76\u201317\u00b78) in the ipilimumab\n\n10 mg/kg group and 11\u00b75 months (9\u00b79\u201313\u00b73) in the 3 mg/kg group (HR 0\u00b784, 95% CI 0\u00b770\u20130\u00b799; p=0\u00b704; figure 2A). 1-year overall survival was 54\u00b73% (95% CI 49\u00b70\u201359\u00b73) in the 10 mg/kg group versus 47\u00b76% (42\u00b74\u201352\u00b77) in the 3 mg/kg group; 2-year overall survival was 38\u00b75% (33\u00b74\u201343\u00b75) versus 31\u00b70% (26\u00b72\u201335\u00b78) and 3-year overall survival was 31\u00b72% (26\u00b74\u201336\u00b70) versus 23\u00b72% (18\u00b79\u201327\u00b77). For patients with asymptomatic brain metastases at baseline (65 patients in the 10 mg/kg group, 62 patients in the 3 mg/kg group), median overall survival was 7\u00b70 months (95% CI 4\u00b70\u201312\u00b78) in the 10 mg/kg group (54 deaths) and 5\u00b77 months (4\u00b72\u20137\u00b70) in the 3 mg/kg group (58 deaths; HR 0\u00b771, 95% CI 0\u00b749\u20131\u00b704; figure 2B). Overall survival results in prespecified subgroups were consistent with the overall result (figure 3). Sensitivity analyses for overall survival using an unstratified analysis and censoring for subsequent therapy did not show differences between the 10 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg groups (appendix pp 6, 11). Post-hoc analyses of overall survival by subsequent systemic therapy are shown in the appendix (p 12).\n\nDuring the study, 328 patients had a progression event in the 10 mg/kg group and 330 patients had an event in the 3 mg/kg group. Median progression-free survival was 2\u00b78 months (95% CI 2\u00b78\u20133\u00b70) in the 10 mg/kg group and 2\u00b78 months (2\u00b78\u20132\u00b78) in the 3 mg/kg group (figure 2C). A similar proportion of patients in the 10 mg/kg group and 3 mg/kg group had an objective response and achieved disease control (table 2). Because of the prespecified hierarchical testing procedure, the nonsignificant p value for progression-free survival meant that statistical significance for objective response and disease control was not formally tested. Median duration of response was similar between the dose groups (table 2); median duration of stable disease was 5\u00b76 months (95% CI 3\u00b70\u20138\u00b70) in the 10 mg/kg group and 3\u00b72 months (2\u00b77\u20135\u00b76) in the 3 mg/kg group.\n\n286 (79%) of 364 patients in the 10 mg/kg group and 228 (63%) of 362 patients in the 3 mg/kg group had a treatment-related adverse event of any grade (table 3). The most common grade 3\u20134 treatment-related adverse events were diarrhoea (37 [10%] patients in the 10 mg/kg group *vs* 21 [6%] patients in the 3 mg/kg group), colitis (19 [5%] *vs* nine [2%]), increased alanine aminotransferase (12 [3%] *vs* two [1%]), and hypophysitis (ten [3%] *vs* seven [2%]). Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 133 (37%) of 364 patients in the 10 mg/kg group; the most common were diarrhoea in 39 (11%) patients, colitis in 29 (8%), and hypophysitis in 16 (4%). In the 3 mg/kg group, treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 66 (18%) of 362 patients; the most common were diarrhoea in 20 (6%) patients and colitis in 11 (3%).\n\nAdverse events leading to discontinuation were more frequent in the 10 mg/kg group than in the 3 mg/kg group, both for any-grade events (114 [31%] *vs* 68 [19%]) and grade 3\u20134 events (87 [24%] *vs* 44 [12%]). Events leading to discontinuation in more than 1% of patients in either the 10 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg group included diarrhoea (24 [7%] *vs* 14 [4%]), colitis (14 [4%] *vs* nine [2%]), malignant neoplasm progression (five [1%] *vs* two [1%]), general health deterioration (one [<1%] *vs* five [1%]), hypophysitis (five [1%] *vs* four [1%]), increased alanine aminotransferase (six [2%] *vs* one [<1%]), increased aspartate aminotransferase (six [2%] *vs* one [<1%]), and dyspnoea (five [1%] *vs* one [<1%]).\n\nImmune-related adverse events (ie, those consistent with an immune-mediated mechanism and identified by the investigator as treatment related) occurred in 269 (74%) of 364 patients in the 10 mg/kg group (110 [30%] were grade 3\u20134) and 197 (54%) of 362 patients in the 3 mg/kg group (50 [14%] were grade 3\u20134; appendix pp 7\u20139). The most common immune-related adverse events in the 10 mg/kg group versus the 3 mg/kg group were diarrhoea (136 [37%] *vs* 84 [23%]), rash (95 [26%] *vs* 50 [14%]), and pruritus (82 [23%] *vs* 81 [22%]). During the induction phase, one patient in the 3 mg/kg group died due to an immune-related adverse event (large intestine perforation). Median time to onset and resolution of immune-related adverse events are shown in the appendix (p 10).\n\nIn the safety population, 239 (66%) of 364 patients in the 10 mg/kg group died due to disease progression versus 257 (71%) of 362 in the 3 mg/kg group. Six patients died because of treatment-related adverse events (four [1%] in the 10 mg/kg group: diarrhoea leading to general deterioration, fulminant colitis, multiorgan failure, and bowel perforation *vs* two [1%] in the 3 mg/kg group: multifocal colon perforation, and myocardial infarction from complications of diarrhoea and colitis). The remaining deaths in the 10 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg groups were reported as unknown (12 [3%] *vs* 12 [3%]) and other (six [2%; one each of pulmonary embolism, retroperitoneal bleeding, hypercalcaemia and alteration of general status, pneumonia, Alzheimer's disease, and ventricular haemorrhage] *vs* eight [3%; one each of chronic myeloid leukaemia, pulmonary embolism, bronchial adenocarcinoma, sepsis, pneumonia and acute cardiovascular failure associated with pneumonia, left hemiparesis, necrotising faciitis, and suicide]).\n\nThe EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status questionnaire was completed by 321 (88%) of 365 patients in the 10 mg/kg group and 317 (88%) of 362 patients in the 3 mg/kg group. Missing data for this assessment seems to have occurred randomly because the percentage of patients completing the questionnaire was similar in each treatment group at all timepoints (figure 4). The EQ-5D index was completed by 333 (91%) of 365 patients in the 10 mg/kg group versus 331 (91%) of 362 in the 3 mg/kg group; the EQ-5D VAS was completed by 331 (91%) patients versus 328 (91%) patients.

Mean change from baseline to week 12 for the 10 mg/kg group was \u201313\u00b726 (95% CI \u201317\u00b757 to \u20138\u00b795) and for the 3 mg/kg was \u20138\u00b707 (\u201311\u00b746 to \u20134\u00b768). By contrast, clinically significant declines were only seen in the 10 mg/kg group for the EQ-5D index and EQ-5D VAS mean scores from baseline to week 12 and from baseline to end of treatment (figure 4B, C). Mean change in EQ-5D index from baseline to week 12 for the 10 mg/kg group was \u20130\u00b709 (95% CI \u20130\u00b712 to \u20130\u00b706) and for the 3 mg/kg group was \u20130\u00b705 (\u20130\u00b708 to \u20130\u00b702). Mean change in EQ-5D VAS from baseline to week 12 for the 10 mg/kg group was \u20138\u00b754 (95% CI \u201312\u00b786 to \u20134\u00b722) and for the 3 mg/kg group was \u20132\u00b711 (\u20136\u00b728 to 2\u00b706). The long-term effect of both ipilimumab doses on quality of life cannot be determined because patients were not followed up beyond the end of treatment.\n\n# **Discussion**\n\nIn this randomised, double-blind, multicentre, phase 3 trial of patients with advanced melanoma, treatment with ipilimumab 10 mg/kg resulted in a significant improvement in overall survival compared with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg. The improvement in overall survival with the higher ipilimumab dose supports previous results from a phase 2 dose-ranging study, which showed a median overall survival of 11\u00b74 months (95% CI 6\u00b79\u201316\u00b71) in patients treated with ipilimumab 10 mg/kg versus 8\u00b77 months (6\u00b79\u201312\u00b71) in patients treated with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg.6 However, no differences were seen in the present analysis between ipilimumab dose groups regarding the secondary endpoints of progression-free survival, objective response, or disease control, which is also consistent with previous studies. Consistent with the original dosefinding study, an increase in treatment-related adverse events was seen with ipilimumab 10 mg/kg compared with 3 mg/kg in the present study.\n\nMedian overall survival was 15*\u00b7*7 months in the 10 mg/kg group and 11*\u00b7*5 months in the 3 mg/kg group, with 3-year overall survival of 31% versus 23%. Although direct comparisons cannot be made because of trial differences,\n\n![](_page_9_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\n*Figure 4:* **Quality-of-life outcomes by ipilimumab dose**\n\nMean change from baseline in patients who received ipilimumab 10 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg for EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status (A), EQ-5D summary index (B), and EQ-5D VAS (C). Completion proportions are expressed as number of patients who completed the assessment over the number of eligible patients. Error bars are 95% CIs. Median baseline values for EORTC QLQ-C30 were 66\u00b77 for both 10 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg groups, for the EQ-5D summary index were 0\u00b783 for both dose groups, and for the EQ-5D VAS were 70\u00b70 for both dose groups. Clinical significance (denoted by the horizontal dashed line at these points) is determined by the MID value for each test, which is 10 points for EORTC QLQ-C30, 0\u00b78 points for EQ-5D, and 7 points for EQ-VAS. HRQoL=health-related quality of life. EORTC=European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer. EQ-5D=European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions. VAS=visual analogue scale. MID=minimal important difference.\n\n> the results for the 3 mg/kg group are consistent with a pooled analysis of overall survival data from multiple ipilimumab studies (with monotherapy doses ranging from 0*\u00b7*3 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg) in which median overall survival was 11*\u00b7*4 months and the 3-year survival rate was\n\n22%.5 Again, although direct cross-trial comparisons cannot be made, the survival results of the 10 mg/kg group seem to improve on those results. However, our results should be interpreted in the context of the changing treatment landscape, in which ipilimumab monotherapy is no longer used in the first-line setting for melanoma in most countries where improved drugs that result in increased survival have become available. Keeping in mind the caveats of cross-trial comparison, the overall survival benefit of ipilimumab 10 mg/kg compared with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg was not favourable compared with nivolumab11,19 and pembrolizumab20,21 monotherapies, both of which also show increased tumour response and improved tolerability. Additionally, BRAF and MEK inhibitor combinations of dabrafenib plus trametinib increase survival in treatment-naive patients with *BRAF*V600E-mutant or *BRAF*V600K-mutant metastatic melanoma compared with controls.22,23 Ipilimumab at 3 mg/kg also shows increased benefit when used in combination with nivolumab compared with ipilimumab monotherapy, as seen in the CheckMate 067 study,24 in which progression-free survival was 11\u00b75 months (95% CI 8\u00b79\u201316\u00b77) with the combination versus 2\u00b79 months (2\u00b78\u20133\u00b74) with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg alone, and objective response was achieved in 181 (58%) of 314 patients versus 60 (19%) of 315 patients.\n\nAnalyses of prespecified subgroups showed an overall survival benefit that generally favoured the ipilimumab 10 mg/kg dose. However, it is important to keep in mind that this study was not powered for these subgroup analyses. Baseline characteristics were generally similar between dose groups for patients with *BRAF* mutations, although more patients in the ipilimumab 10 mg/kg group were younger than 65 years, had normal lactate dehydrogenase concentrations, or had M0, M1a, or M1b stage disease when compared with patients in the 3 mg/kg group. Additionally, subsequent systemic therapy was received by more than a third of patients in each dose group. Post-hoc analyses assessing the effect of subsequent systemic therapies on overall survival for all patients show the longest overall survival for both dose groups in patients who received subsequent immunotherapy (primarily anti-PD-1), compared with those who recevied BRAF and MEK inhibitors or chemotherapy. Although the analysis is exploratory and the results might be biased by patient selection, the finding is interesting in view of the present debate on sequencing of BRAF and MEK inhibition versus immunotherapy in patients with a *BRAF* mutation.\n\nThe results seen in this study showing a difference in survival without a difference in the proportion of patients with an objective response or progression-free survival are not unexpected in view of previous studies with ipilimumab, in which a difference was seen for survival but not necessarily for response.2,3 Additionally, although previous trials have shown that ipilimumab reduces the number of patients who progress compared with control groups, the median values for progression-free survival with both 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg doses of ipilimumab were consistent with that seen in the present trial.2,3 One possible explanation for increased overall survival without response benefit is the immunological memory provided by ipilimumab treatment, which is increased in the 10 mg/kg dose group.6 The survival benefit with ipilimumab might be obtained from unconventional response patterns or stable disease.\n\nConsistent with the phase 2 dose-ranging ipilimumab study,6 the proportion of patients with treatment-related adverse events in the present study was higher with ipilimumab 10 mg/kg than with 3 mg/kg, as was the proportion of patients with adverse events leading to discontinuation. The frequency and types of adverse events were consistent with those reported in previous phase 3 trials of ipilimumab in advanced melanoma, with immune-related adverse events being the most commonly reported.2,3 Most adverse events resolved in both dose groups with established management algorithms. Additionally, time to onset, resolution frequency, and time to resolution were similar between the dose groups. Finally, during the induction phase, clinically significant reductions in the quality-of-life scales were seen more frequently and earlier for the 10 mg/kg group compared with the 3 mg/kg dose group; however, conclusions cannot be made about the long-term effect of either ipilimumab dose on quality of life because of the limited duration of follow-up for this endpoint.\n\nIn view of the present treatment landscape in advanced melanoma, the most substantial limitation of this study was the outdated nature of the exclusion criteria, which required patients to have no previous therapy with BRAF or immune checkpoint inhibitors. Additionally, quality of life data were collected only during the induction phase of the study, which limited the long-term assessment of these patients. Longer quality-of-life follow-up of these patients could have contributed to the assessment of the benefit\u2013risk ratio of the regimen.\n\nIn conclusion, treatment with ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg led to a significant improvement in overall survival compared with ipilimumab at 3 mg/kg in patients with advanced melanoma who had not received a previous BRAF inhibitor or immune checkpoint inhibitor, but was associated with a higher frequency of treatment-related adverse events and adverse events leading to discontinuation. The clinical relevance of the improved overall survival with 10 mg/kg compared with 3 mg/kg of ipilimumab must be assessed in the context of several factors: the magnitude of effect seen; the attenuation of effect seen in the sensitivity analyses; the relative safety profile of each dose; and the changes in the treatment landscape since this study was initiated. Although the therapeutic landscape for first-line treatment of advanced melanoma has changed, the clinical use of ipilimumab 10 mg/kg monotherapy in patients with PD-1 refractory disease might warrant further assessment; for example, in patients with unmet medical need.\n\n#### **Contributors**\n\nPAA, MDV, CR, AM, VC-S, AA, CLe, LB, OH, PR, CM, CG, CLo, BD, LT, J-JG, GL, MN, RG, JP, FG, CH, VF, MS, DS, LM, IMS, and MM contributed to patients' treatment, data acquisition, data interpretation, and writing of the manuscript.

We report a phase 3 trial comparing the benefit\u2013risk profile of ipilimumab 10 mg/kg versus 3 mg/kg.**\n\n**Methods This randomised, double-blind, multicentre, phase 3 trial was done in 87 centres in 21 countries worldwide. Patients with untreated or previously treated unresectable stage III or IV melanoma, without previous treatment with BRAF inhibitors or immune checkpoint inhibitors, were randomly assigned (1:1) with an interactive voice response system by the permuted block method using block size 4 to ipilimumab 10 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg, administered by intravenous infusion for 90 min every 3 weeks for four doses. Patients were stratified by metastasis stage, previous treatment for metastatic melanoma, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status. The patients, investigators, and site staff were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population and safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This study is completed and was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01515189.**\n\n**Findings Between Feb 29, and July 9, 2012, 727 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to ipilimumab 10 mg/kg (365 patients; 364 treated) or ipilimumab 3 mg/kg (362 patients; all treated). Median follow-up was 14\u00b75 months (IQR 4\u00b76\u201342\u00b73) for the ipilimumab 10 mg/kg group and 11\u00b72 months (4\u00b79\u201329\u00b74) for the ipilimumab 3 mg/kg group. Median overall survival was 15\u00b77 months (95% CI 11\u00b76\u201317\u00b78) for ipilimumab 10 mg/kg compared with 11\u00b75 months (9\u00b79\u201313\u00b73) for ipilimumab 3 mg/kg (hazard ratio 0\u00b784, 95% CI 0\u00b770\u20130\u00b799; p=0\u00b704). The most common grade 3\u20134 treatment-related adverse events were diarrhoea (37 [10%] of 364 patients in the 10 mg/kg group** *vs* **21 [6%] of 362 patients in the 3 mg/kg group), colitis (19 [5%]** *vs* **nine [2%]), increased alanine aminotransferase (12 [3%]** *vs* **two [1%]), and hypophysitis (ten [3%]** *vs* **seven [2%]). Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 133 (37%) patients in the 10 mg/kg group and 66 (18%) patients in the 3 mg/kg group; four (1%) versus two (<1%) patients died from treatment-related adverse events.**\n\n**Interpretation In patients with advanced melanoma, ipilimumab 10 mg/kg resulted in significantly longer overall survival than did ipilimumab 3 mg/kg, but with increased treatment-related adverse events. Although the treatment landscape for advanced melanoma has changed since this study was initiated, the clinical use of ipilimumab in refractory patients with unmet medical needs could warrant further assessment.**\n\n**Funding Bristol-Myers Squibb.**\n\n# **Introduction**\n\nThe enhancement of antitumour immunity through blockade of immune checkpoint molecules has led to a substantial survival advantage in patients with metastatic melanoma compared with patients given previously available treatments. Ipilimumab is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody designed to block CTLA-4.1 Ipilimumab was the first therapy to show an improvement in overall survival of patients with metastatic melanoma in a randomised, controlled phase 3 trial. It has a manageable safety profile as monotherapy at both 3 mg/kg in previously treated patients2 and 10 mg/kg in combination with dacarbazine in treatment-naive patients.3 A 5-year survival benefit has been seen with ipilimumab 10 mg/kg plus dacarbazine in a phase 3 trial.4 Additionally, a pooled analysis of prospective and retrospective trials in patients with advanced melanoma who were followed up for 10 years, which includes this 5-year dacarbazine trial, showed durable long-term survival in more than 20% of patients, with a plateau around year 3.5 Ipilimumab at a dose of 3 mg/kg is approved in several countries for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma and a dose of 10 mg/kg is approved in the USA as an adjuvant treatment for resected stage III melanoma.\n\n#### *Lancet Oncol* **2017; 18: 611\u201322**\n\nPublished**Online** March 27, 2017 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/ S1470-2045(17)30231-0\n\nSee **Comment** page 558 **Istituto Nazionale Tumori Fondazione Pascale, Naples, Italy** (P A Ascierto MD)**; Medical Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Milan, Italy** (M Del Vecchio MD)**; Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus Grand Paris, Villejuif, France** (Prof C Robert MD)**; Department of Diagnostics and Cancer Immunology, Greater Poland Cancer Centre, Poznan Medical University, Poznan, Poland** (Prof A Mackiewicz MD)**; IOV-IRCCS, Melanoma Oncology Unit, Padova, Italy** (V Chiarion-Sileni MD)**; Hospital Clinic and Institut d\u00b4Investigacions Biom\u00e8diques August Pi I Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain** (A Arance MD)**; AP-HP Dermatology CIC Departments, Saint-Louis Hospital, INSERM U976, Universit\u00e9 Paris Diderot, Paris, France** (Prof C Lebb\u00e9 MD)**; Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark** (L Bastholt MD)**; The Angeles Clinic and Research Institute, Los Angeles, CA, USA** (O Hamid MD)**; Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center, Warsaw, Poland** (Prof P Rutkowski MD)**; Chris O'Brien Lifehouse and Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Camperdown, NSW, Australia (C McNeil MD), Melanoma Institute Australia, Sydney, NSW, Australia** (C McNeil)**; Eberhard Karls University, T\u00fcbingen, Germany** (Prof C Garbe MD)**; University Medical Center, Mainz, Germany** (C Loquai MD)**; Department of Oncodermatology, INSERM** \n\n![](_page_0_Picture_16.jpeg)\n\n**Research Unit 892, Nantes University Hospital, Nantes, France** (Prof B Dreno MD)**; Department of Dermatology, Centre Hospitalier Lyon-Sud, Pierre-B\u00e9nite, France** (Prof L Thomas MD)**; Hospital de la Timone, Marseille, France** (Prof J-J Grob MD)**; National Institute of Oncology, Budapest, Hungary** (Prof G Liszkay)**; Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway**  (M Nyakas MD)**; Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Hannover, Germany** (Prof R Gutzmer MD)**; Wojewodzkie Centrum Oncologii, Gda\u0144sk, Poland** (J Pikiel MD)**; Department of Dermatology, Reims University Hospital, Reims, France** (F Grange MD**); Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria** (C Hoeller MD)**; Istituti Fisioterapici Ospitalieri, Rome, Italy** (V Ferraresi MD)**; Cross Cancer Institute, Edmonton, AB, Canada** (M Smylie MD)**; University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany** (Prof D Schadendorf MD)**; H\u00f4spital Claude Huriez, Lille, France** (Prof L Mortier MD)**; Herlev Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Herlev, Denmark** (I M Svane MD)**; Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ, USA** (D Hennicken MSc, A Qureshi MD)**; and University Hospital of Siena, Istituto Toscano Tumori, Siena, Italy** (M Maio MD)\n\nCorrespondence to: Dr Paolo A Ascierto, Melanoma Cancer Immunotherapy and Innovative Therapy Unit, Istituto Nazionale Tumori Fondazione \"G. Pascale\", Via Mariano Semmola, Naples 80131, Italy **paolo.ascierto@gmail.com**\n\nSee **Online** for appendix\n\n## **Research in context**\n\n## **Evidence before this study**\n\nTo identify other studies of ipilimumab in melanoma, we searched PubMed and congress abstracts from the annual meetings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the European Society for Medical Oncology, and the Society for Melanoma Research for articles published in English between Jan 1, 2010, and July 31, 2016. Our search terms included \"ipilimumab\", \"anti-CTLA-4\", \"BMS-734016\", \"MDX-010\", and \"MDX-101\". We focused on survival results in melanoma. Ipilimumab was the first drug to show a survival improvement in patients with metastatic melanoma in a randomised controlled phase 3 trial. Together, efficacy data across phase 2 and phase 3 studies show an overall survival benefit for both 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg doses of ipilimumab compared with controls. Additional data from a dose-ranging phase 2 study suggest longer survival with the 10 mg/kg dose than with lower doses. No studies done so far permit conclusive comparison of ipilimumab 10 mg/kg with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg.\n\n## **Added value of this study**\n\nWhen the two doses of ipilimumab were directly compared in this study, overall survival was significantly improved with the\n\nA randomised, phase 2, dose-ranging study of ipilimumab at 0\u00b73 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg in patients with previously treated metastatic melanoma reported an improvement in best overall response with an increased ipilimumab dose, although with a higher frequency of immune-related adverse events.6 The study was not designed to detect statistical differences in survival between the groups, but reported an improved median overall survival and 1-year overall survival at 10 mg/kg compared with lower doses, although crossover to 10 mg/kg was permitted for the lower doses.\n\nTogether, efficacy data across phase 2 and phase 3 studies show increased overall survival for patients treated with either 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg doses of ipilimumab compared with controls. However, no studies done so far permit conclusive comparison of these two doses. To further investigate the benefit of higher-dose ipilimumab in stage III unresectable or stage IV melanoma, we report survival outcomes from a comparison of ipilimumab 10 mg/kg with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg in a phase 3 trial.\n\n# **Methods**\n\n## **Study design and patients**\n\nThis was a randomised, double-blind, multicentre, phase 3 study done in 87 centres in 21 countries worldwide (appendix pp 13\u201314), with the largest proportion of participants from Europe. Eligible patients had treated or untreated histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable stage III or IV melanoma (advanced melanoma) and no previous therapy with BRAF inhibitors, CTLA-4 or PD-1 antagonists, or PD-L1 or CD137 agonists. 10 mg/kg dose compared with the 3 mg/kg dose, whereas the 3 mg/kg dose had a more favourable safety profile and a survival benefit consistent with that seen in other ipilimumab 3 mg/kg studies in advanced melanoma. Quality of life generally worsened during the ipilimumab induction phase treatment, and this worsening seemed to be more pronounced with 10 mg/kg compared with 3 mg/kg. However, insufficient duration of follow-up prevents conclusions to be drawn regarding the long-term effect of ipilimumab on quality of life.\n\n## **Implications of all the available evidence**\n\nThe treatment landscape for first-line treatment of patients with advanced melanoma has changed since this study was initiated, with ipilimumab being succeeded by newer treatments. However, the increased survival benefit of ipilimumab 10 mg/kg compared with 3 mg/kg suggests that the clinical utility of ipilimumab in refractory patients with high unmet medical need could warrant further assessment.\n\nOther melanoma treatments were permitted with a washout period of 4 weeks for all previous anticancer therapy and at least 2 years for systemic immunosuppressive drugs, except for episodic low-dose corticosteroids. Disease progression was based on recommendation of the enrolling physician. Other eligibility criteria included an age of at least 18 years, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 or 1, and measurable disease based on modified WHO criteria within 28 days of first dose. Laboratory testing required for study entry included baseline DNA samples from peripheral blood for testing of CD86 and CTLA-4 polymorphisms and genome-wide association analysis for immune-related adverse events, and testing for adequate haematological, renal, and hepatic function. Key exclusion criteria were the presence of brain metastases with symptoms or requiring treatment; a diagnosis of primary ocular melanoma; a history of autoimmune disease; uncontrolled infectious disease, any immunodeficiency disease, splenectomy, or splenic irradiation; or previous allogeneic stem cell transplantation.\n\nThe study protocol and the statistical analysis plan are available in the appendix. The institutional review board at each study site approved the study protocol. The study was done in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, as defined by the International Conference on Harmonisation and in accordance with the ethical principles underlying European Union Directive 2001/20/EC and the United States Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 50. All patients provided informed written consent.\n\n## **Randomisation and masking**\n\nPatients were randomly assigned (1:1) to treatment with ipilimumab at a dose of 10 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg by use of an interactive voice response system. To be enrolled in the system, the following information was required: date of birth, date of signed informed consent, sex**,** metastasis (M) substage, yes or no for previous treatment of metastatic melanoma, and ECOG performance status. Randomisation was done by the permutated block method using block size 4 and was stratified by M substage (M0/ M1a/M1b *vs* M1c without brain metastases *vs* M1c with brain metastases), previous treatment for metastatic melanoma (yes *vs* no), and ECOG performance status (0 *vs* 1). After completion of all screening evaluations, an unmasked pharmacist called the interactive voice response system to obtain treatment assignment and an unmasked site monitor provided oversight of drug supply and other unmasked study documentation. The funder, patients, investigators, and site staff remained masked to treatment assignment. An independent data monitoring committee was unmasked to review emerging safety data.\n\n## **Procedures**\n\nIn both 10 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg dose groups, ipilimumab was administered by intravenous infusion for 90 min every 3 weeks for four doses. Treatment was continued for a maximum of four doses during the initial treatment phase until confirmed progression defined by immunerelated response criteria,7,8 unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. In the absence of intolerable toxicity, patients who had stable disease for 3 months or more, or a partial or complete response after the last dose, and then progressed per immune-related response criteria, were eligible for retreatment with the study drug per the original randomisation and dose scheme. We assessed all response-based endpoints using modified WHO criteria, consistent with previous ipilimumab studies.2,3 Tumour response was based on investigator assessment, which was done during the initial treatment phase at screening, at weeks 12, 16, and 24, and every 12 weeks thereafter, and was done for confirmation of response and progression, including new lesions. However, because ipilimumab can induce responses that occur after initial tumour volume increase or appearance of new lesions, discontinuation criteria were based on immune-related response criteria that address unconventional response patterns to ensure patients were not prematurely discontinued.7,8\n\nWe did safety evaluations in patients who had received at least one dose of study treatment, and graded severity of adverse events according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0.9 The funder provided guidelines for management of adverse events, which have been published.10\u201312 We did not allow crossover or reduction of ipilimumab dose. Study dose could be delayed for nonskin-related, treatment-related adverse events that were higher than grade 2; grade 3 or higher laboratory abnormality; skin-related, any-cause adverse events that were grade 3 or higher; or an adverse event warranting delay by the judgment of the investigator. Laboratory monitoring included haematology, chemistry, C-reactive protein, endocrine, and pharmacokinetic or anti-drug antibody testing, and occurred at weeks 1, 4, 7, 10, 12, and 24 and at the end-of-treatment visit, except for endocrine testing, which occurred at weeks 1, 4, 7, 10, and 12. *BRAF* mutation testing was done locally per local regulations and standards.\n\nWe collected health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) questionnaire data, as available, in all patients randomly assigned, at weeks 1, 4, 7, 10, and 12, and at the end-oftreatment visit. Assessment of HRQoL was done at each site with the appropriately translated and validated version\n\n![](_page_2_Figure_8.jpeg)\n\n*Figure 1:* **Trial profile**\n\n|                                 | Ipilimumab<br>10 mg/kg<br>(n=365) | Ipilimumab<br>3 mg/kg<br>(n=362) |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Age (years)                     | 62 (49\u201370)                        | 62 (51\u201371)                       |\n| <65                             | 224 (61%)                         | 208 (57%)                        |\n| \u226565                             | 141 (39%)                         | 154 (43%)                        |\n| Sex                             |                                   |                                  |\n| Male                            | 219 (60%)                         | 231 (64%)                        |\n| Female                          | 146 (40%)                         | 131 (36%)                        |\n| Race                            |                                   |                                  |\n| White                           | 361 (99%)                         | 359 (99%)                        |\n| Black or African American       | 1 (<1%)                           | 1 (<1%)                          |\n| Asian                           | 2 (1%)                            | 1 (<1%)                          |\n| Other                           | 1 (<1%)                           | 1 (<1%)                          |\n| ECOG PS                         |                                   |                                  |\n| 0                               | 262 (72%)                         | 253 (70%)                        |\n| 1                               | 103 (28%)                         | 109 (30%)                        |\n| M stage                         |                                   |                                  |\n| M0, M1a, or M1b                 | 136 (37%)                         | 142 (39%)                        |\n| M1c without brain metastases    | 164 (45%)                         | 158 (44%)                        |\n| M1c with brain metastases       | 65 (18%)                          | 62 (17%)                         |\n| Previous treatment for melanoma |                                   |                                  |\n| Yes                             | 205 (56%)                         | 205 (57%)                        |\n| No                              | 160 (44%)                         | 157 (43%)                        |\n| Previous therapy                |                                   |                                  |\n| Any previous systemic therapy*  | 206\u2020 (56%)                        | 205 (57%)                        |\n| Any previous radiotherapy       | 107 (29%)                         | 96 (27%)                         |\n| Any previous surgery            | 359 (98%)                         | 346 (96%)                        |\n| Lactate dehydrogenase           |                                   |                                  |\n| \u2264ULN                            | 222 (61%)                         | 219 (60%)                        |\n| >ULN                            | 133 (36%)                         | 136 (38%)                        |\n| \u22642 \u00d7ULN                         | 321 (88%)                         | 306 (85%)                        |\n| >2 \u00d7ULN                         | 34 (9%)                           | 49 (14%)                         |\n| Not reported                    | 10 (3%)                           | 7 (2%)                           |\n| AJCC disease stage              |                                   |                                  |\n| III                             | 35 (10%)                          | 35 (10%)                         |\n| IV                              | 330 (90%)                         | 327 (90%)                        |\n| BRAF status                     |                                   |                                  |\n| Mutation, V600                  | 75 (21%)                          | 75 (21%)                         |\n| Mutation, other                 | 5 (1%)                            | 4 (1%)                           |\n| No mutation<br>Unknown          | 225 (62%)<br>60 (16%)             | 237 (65%)<br>46 (13%)            |\n|                                 |                                   |                                  |\n\nData are median (IQR) or n (%).

Assessments were done using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 questionnaire version 313 and the European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) summary index and visual analogue scale (VAS).14\n\nEORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item, self-administered, multidimensional, cancer-specific HRQoL patientreported outcome questionnaire.13 A difference of 10 points on a 100-point scale was regarded as clinically significant, as is common in clinical trials in which sample size is not based on the HRQoL endpoint.15\n\nThe EQ-5D is a standardised measure of health status developed by the EuroQoL Group and provides a generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal.14 The EQ-5D consists of a descriptive system comprising the five dimensions of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression, and the EQ-5D VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a vertical VAS. Score differences of 0\u00b708 for the EQ-5D utility index score and 7 for the EQ-5D VAS were regarded as clinically significant.16\n\n## **Outcomes**\n\nOverall survival was the primary endpoint, defined as the time between randomisation date and death, assessed at a minimum of every 12 weeks, censored at the last date the participant was known to be alive.\n\nSecondary endpoints were progression-free survival defined as the time between randomisation date and the date of progression or death, whichever occurred first; objective response and disease control as per modified WHO criteria; duration of response and stable disease by modified WHO criteria; overall survival on a yearly basis for up to 5 years; and overall survival in the subset of patients with asymptomatic brain metastases. Additional secondary endpoints were evaluation of safety for both dose groups and HRQoL.\n\n## **Statistical analysis**\n\nA study sample of 700 patients was planned for the primary endpoint of overall survival to obtain the 540 events necessary to detect an overall hazard ratio (HR) of 0*\u00b7*744 between the two randomised groups using a two-sided, log-rank test with an experiment-wise type I error of 0*\u00b7*05 with at least 90% power. An interim analysis for overall survival was originally planned at about 67% (360 deaths) of the total events. However, as a result of the faster than expected enrolment of less than 5 months, the projected interim analysis would have had a followup period of less than 18 months. Therefore, the protocol was amended on June 24, 2013, to remove the interim analysis and wait for the planned final analysis with a survival follow-up of at least 2 years.\n\nFor the primary endpoint (overall survival) and secondary endpoint (progression-free survival), a logrank test compared randomised groups according to stratification factors, with HR and its associated 95% CI estimated using a stratified Cox model with randomised group as the only covariate. In both analyses, we estimated the event-free survival probabilities with the Kaplan-Meier\n\n**Articles**\n\n![](_page_4_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\n*Figure 2:* **Overall survival and progression-free survival** (A) Overall survival in the intention-to-treat population.

Additionally, we did subgroup analyses for overall survival including the prespecified subgroups of age, race, sex, M stage, ECOG performance status, previous treatment for melanoma, and baseline lactate dehydrogenase, as well as *BRAF* mutation status, which, although not a prespecified subgroup in the protocol, was generated before database lock. We analysed descriptive statistics for HRQoL endpoints at baseline for all patients with baseline measurements, and for change from baseline for all patients with both baseline and on-study assessment for a particular timepoint; mean change from baseline and 95% CI for each timepoint were plotted for each scale.\n\n> To preserve a type I error rate of 5%, a hierarchical testing approach was applied in the following order: overall survival, progression-free survival, objective response, and disease control.

We did safety assessments for all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. In general, missing values were not imputed, except for EORTC QLQ-C30, in which missing values for missing items were imputed by assuming that the missing items had values equal to the average of the items that were present for any scale in which at least half of the items were completed (method from the scoring manual). Irrespective of missing data, all participants contributed to the calculation of the following tumour response endpoints: best overall response or disease control (by inclusion in the denominators), and the Kaplan-Meier analyses of duration of response, duration of stable disease, and progression-free survival (by censoring, as appropriate). A data and safety monitoring committee was established to provide general oversight. All statistical analyses were done with SAS version 9.3 and 9.4.\n\nThis study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01515189.\n\n## **Role of the funding source**\n\nThis study was designed by the funder. Data were collected by the investigators and analysed by the funder in collaboration with all authors. Data were interpreted jointly by the funder and the authors. Writing and editorial support were funded by the funder of the study. All authors had access to the data and the corresponding author had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\n\n# **Results**\n\nBetween Feb 29, and July 9, 2012, we enrolled 831 patients. 727 patients were randomly assigned to treatment and included in the intention-to-treat population for efficacy: 365 to the 10 mg/kg group and 362 to the 3 mg/kg group (figure 1). One patient in the 10 mg/kg group was not treated due to an adverse event and therefore the safety analysis consisted of 364 patients for the 10 mg/kg group and 362 patients for the 3 mg/kg group. Baseline characteristics were balanced between the two dose groups (table 1). Baseline characteristics were also generally balanced between the 80 (22%) patients in the 10 mg/kg group and the 79 (22%) patients in the 3 mg/kg group with *BRAF* mutation-positive tumours (appendix p 2).\n\nThe database lock occurred on March 18, 2016, after trial completion. At a minimum follow-up of 43 months, the median number of doses of ipilimumab received per patient in the initial treatment phase was 4\u00b70 (IQR 3\u00b70\u20134\u00b70) in the 10 mg/kg group, with 212 (58%) of 364 patients completing all four doses, and 4\u00b70 ( 3\u00b70\u20134\u00b70) in the 3 mg/kg group, with 241 (67%) of 362 patients completing all four doses. At database lock, 23 (6%) of 364 patients in the 10 mg/kg group and 32 (9%) of 362 patients in the 3 mg/kg group entered the first retreatment phase. In the initial treatment phase, the most common reason for discontinuation in both groups was disease progression, followed by treatment-related adverse events. Discontinuation due to disease progression was lower in the 10 mg/kg group (109 [30%] of 364 patients) than in the 3 mg/kg group (155 [43%] of 362 patients), whereas discontinuation due to treatmentrelated adverse events was higher in the 10 mg/kg group (86 [24%] of 364 patients) than in the 3 mg/kg group (36 [10%] of 362 patients; figure 1, appendix p 3).\n\nSubsequent systemic therapy was received by 131 (36%) of 365 patients in the 10 mg/kg group (including subsequent immunotherapy in 57 [16%] and subsequent targeted therapy in 37 [10%]) and by 136 (38%) of 362 patients in the 3 mg/kg group (including subsequent immunotherapy in 51 [14%] patients and subsequent targeted therapy in 47 [13%]; appendix p 4). A similar proportion of patients with *BRAF* mutation-positive tumours received subsequent therapy in both dose groups (43 [54%] of 80 patients in the 10 mg/kg group *vs* 47 [59%] of 79 patients in the 3 mg/kg group), although more patients in the 10 mg/kg group than in the 3 mg/kg group received subsequent anti-PD-1 therapy (15 [19%] *vs* eight [10%]; appendix p 5). Median time from randomisation to first subsequent therapy was 216 days (IQR 141\u2013371) for the 10 mg/kg group and 190 days (134\u2013360) for the 3 mg/kg group.\n\nFor overall survival, median follow-up was 14\u00b75 months (IQR 4\u00b76\u201342\u00b73) for the 10 mg/kg group and 11\u00b72 months\n\n|                                          | Ipilimumab 10 mg/kg (n=364) |          |

In the intention-to-treat population, 541 patients died during the study (262 [72%] of 365 patients in the 10 mg/kg group *vs* 279 [77%] of 362 in the 3 mg/kg group). Median overall survival was 15\u00b77 months (95% CI 11\u00b76\u201317\u00b78) in the ipilimumab\n\n10 mg/kg group and 11\u00b75 months (9\u00b79\u201313\u00b73) in the 3 mg/kg group (HR 0\u00b784, 95% CI 0\u00b770\u20130\u00b799; p=0\u00b704; figure 2A). 1-year overall survival was 54\u00b73% (95% CI 49\u00b70\u201359\u00b73) in the 10 mg/kg group versus 47\u00b76% (42\u00b74\u201352\u00b77) in the 3 mg/kg group; 2-year overall survival was 38\u00b75% (33\u00b74\u201343\u00b75) versus 31\u00b70% (26\u00b72\u201335\u00b78) and 3-year overall survival was 31\u00b72% (26\u00b74\u201336\u00b70) versus 23\u00b72% (18\u00b79\u201327\u00b77). For patients with asymptomatic brain metastases at baseline (65 patients in the 10 mg/kg group, 62 patients in the 3 mg/kg group), median overall survival was 7\u00b70 months (95% CI 4\u00b70\u201312\u00b78) in the 10 mg/kg group (54 deaths) and 5\u00b77 months (4\u00b72\u20137\u00b70) in the 3 mg/kg group (58 deaths; HR 0\u00b771, 95% CI 0\u00b749\u20131\u00b704; figure 2B). Overall survival results in prespecified subgroups were consistent with the overall result (figure 3). Sensitivity analyses for overall survival using an unstratified analysis and censoring for subsequent therapy did not show differences between the 10 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg groups (appendix pp 6, 11). Post-hoc analyses of overall survival by subsequent systemic therapy are shown in the appendix (p 12).\n\nDuring the study, 328 patients had a progression event in the 10 mg/kg group and 330 patients had an event in the 3 mg/kg group. Median progression-free survival was 2\u00b78 months (95% CI 2\u00b78\u20133\u00b70) in the 10 mg/kg group and 2\u00b78 months (2\u00b78\u20132\u00b78) in the 3 mg/kg group (figure 2C). A similar proportion of patients in the 10 mg/kg group and 3 mg/kg group had an objective response and achieved disease control (table 2). Because of the prespecified hierarchical testing procedure, the nonsignificant p value for progression-free survival meant that statistical significance for objective response and disease control was not formally tested. Median duration of response was similar between the dose groups (table 2); median duration of stable disease was 5\u00b76 months (95% CI 3\u00b70\u20138\u00b70) in the 10 mg/kg group and 3\u00b72 months (2\u00b77\u20135\u00b76) in the 3 mg/kg group.\n\n286 (79%) of 364 patients in the 10 mg/kg group and 228 (63%) of 362 patients in the 3 mg/kg group had a treatment-related adverse event of any grade (table 3).

McArthur, M.B., B.S., Ph.D., and Antoni Ribas, M.D., Ph.D.\n\n# ABSTRACT\n\n#### **BACKGROUND**\n\nThe combined inhibition of BRAF and MEK is hypothesized to improve clinical outcomes in patients with melanoma by preventing or delaying the onset of resistance observed with BRAF inhibitors alone. This randomized phase 3 study evaluated the combination of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib and the MEK inhibitor cobimetinib.\n\n#### **METHODS**\n\nWe randomly assigned 495 patients with previously untreated unresectable locally advanced or metastatic *BRAF* V600 mutation\u2013positive melanoma to receive vemurafenib and cobimetinib (combination group) or vemurafenib and placebo (control group). The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival.\n\n#### **RESULTS**\n\nThe median progression-free survival was 9.9 months in the combination group and 6.2 months in the control group (hazard ratio for death or disease progression, 0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39 to 0.68; P<0.001). The rate of complete or partial response in the combination group was 68%, as compared with 45% in the control group (P<0.001), including rates of complete response of 10% in the combination group and 4% in the control group. Progression-free survival as assessed by independent review was similar to investigator-assessed progression-free survival. Interim analyses of overall survival showed 9-month survival rates of 81% (95% CI, 75 to 87) in the combination group and 73% (95% CI, 65 to 80) in the control group. Vemurafenib and cobimetinib was associated with a nonsignificantly higher incidence of adverse events of grade 3 or higher, as compared with vemurafenib and placebo (65% vs. 59%), and there was no significant difference in the rate of study-drug discontinuation. The number of secondary cutaneous cancers decreased with the combination therapy.\n\n### **CONCLUSIONS**\n\nThe addition of cobimetinib to vemurafenib was associated with a significant improvement in progression-free survival among patients with *BRAF* V600\u2013mutated metastatic melanoma, at the cost of some increase in toxicity.

The BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (Zelboraf, Genentech) was approved worldwide on the basis of results from a phase 3 trial showing improved progression-free survival and overall survival, as compared with chemotherapy alone; the relative reduction in the risk of death was 63% and in the risk of disease progression was 74%.3 Similar results were also reported for another BRAF inhibitor, dabrafenib,4 which has also been approved widely. Although common toxic events with both agents are similar (rash, fatigue, and joint pain), the incidence of clinically significant photosensitivity is higher with vemurafenib, whereas the incidence of clinically significant pyrexia is higher with dabrafenib. A toxic event common to both is secondary cutaneous squamous-cell carcinomas and keratoacanthomas, which occur in approximately 14 to 26% of patients treated with a BRAF inhibitor, usually within the first 2 to 3 months of therapy.5,6 The skin tumors develop owing to a paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway in keratinocytes with upstream activation of signaling by preexisting *RAS* mutations,7,8 which can be blocked with the addition of a MEK inhibitor.<sup>8</sup>\n\nProgression after a period of tumor response (acquired resistance) is common with single-agent BRAF-inhibitor therapy after a median progression-free survival of 6 to 7 months.3,4 The mechanisms of acquired resistance are diverse and include the reactivation of oncogenic signaling by means of the MAPK pathway in approximately two thirds of cases and mechanisms that lead to MAPK pathway\u2013independent signaling that substitutes for the inhibited driver oncogenic signal within the MAPK pathway.9-11 The finding of multiple genetic mechanisms of escape in individual patients10 implies that upfront inhibition of both MEK and the mutant BRAF kinases might be a strategy for obtaining more durable responses than the inhibition of BRAF alone.\n\nPreclinical and clinical data suggest that the inhibition of both MEK and mutant BRAF kinases might result in a greater initial tumor response, prevent MAPK-driven acquired resistance, and decrease the frequency and severity of toxic events that occur owing to paradoxical MAPK-pathway activation from BRAF-inhibitor monotherapy. Trametinib, a MEK inhibitor, was approved for the treatment of *BRAF*-mutated metastatic melanoma as a single agent after an improvement in progression-free and overall survival was shown in a randomized trial12 and in combination with dabrafenib on the basis of improvement in progression-free survival.13 Cobimetinib (also known as GDC-0973 [Roche] or XL518 [Exelixis]) is an orally bioavailable, potent, and selective MEK inhibitor.14 The most common toxic events associated with single-agent use of cobimetinib in phase 1 testing were diarrhea, rash, fatigue, and edema; grade 3 or higher events included diarrhea, rash, and fatigue.\n\nCobimetinib in combination with vemurafenib was studied in patients with advanced *BRAF* V600\u2013mutated melanoma in a phase 1b study (BRAF Inhibitor in Melanoma [BRIM] 7).15 Dose escalation was stopped at the maximum tolerated single-agent dose of each drug, with daily dosing of vemurafenib and cobimetinib administered for 21 days, followed by 7 days off. At these doses, a confirmed objective response was noted in 55 of 63 patients (87%) who had never received a BRAF inhibitor, and the antitumor activity appeared to be favorable, as compared with historical single-agent vemurafenib activity.3 Common adverse events were similar to those observed with the single agents and included rash, diarrhea, photosensitivity, and hepatic-enzyme abnormalities, and as expected, the incidence of cutaneous secondary cancers was decreased. To confirm and build on these early data, we report on the primary end point of coBRIM, an international, multicenter, randomized phase 3 study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of cobimetinib combined with vemurafenib in previously untreated patients with advanced *BRAF*-mutated melanoma.\n\n# METHODS\n\n#### **PATIENTS**\n\nEligible patients were at least 18 years of age; had histologically confirmed unresectable, locally advanced stage IIIC or stage IV melanoma with a *BRAF* V600 mutation detected with the use of a real-time polymerase-chain-reaction assay (Cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test, Roche Molecular Systems); had measurable disease, according to\n\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\n\nDownloaded from nejm.org on June 16, 2025. For personal use only.\n\nthe Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1,16 as assessed by means of computed tomography; had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance-status score of 0 (fully active and able to carry on all performance without restriction) or 1 (restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature); and had adequate hematologic, hepatic, renal, and cardiac function. Patients with previously treated brain metastases were eligible if they had at least a 3-week history of stable disease.\n\n#### **STUDY OVERSIGHT**\n\nThe study was approved by the institutional review board or ethics committee at each participating institution and was conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. All the patients provided written informed consent. An independent data and safety monitoring committee conducted regular review and evaluation of the safety data.\n\nF. Hoffmann\u2013La Roche/Genentech sponsored the study. All the authors and their research teams collected the data. Representatives of the sponsor and the members of the study steering committee designed the study. Representatives of the sponsor confirmed the accuracy of the data and compiled the data for analysis. The analysis was performed in collaboration with the authors. All the authors had full access to the data and analyses pertinent for the compilation of this report.\n\nTwo of the academic authors wrote the first draft of the manuscript, which was reviewed, modified, and approved in its final version by all the authors. Editorial assistance that did not involve writing was provided by Apothecom and funded by the sponsor. All the authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data reported and for the fidelity of the study to the protocol (available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org).\n\n#### **RANDOMIZATION AND TREATMENT**\n\nFrom January 2013 through January 2014, we enrolled 495 patients at 135 sites in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, Russia, Turkey, and Israel. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive vemurafenib orally (at a dose of 960 mg twice daily) together with either placebo (control group) or cobimetinib (at a dose of 60 mg once daily for 21 days, followed by 7 days off) (combination group). The study treatment continued until patients withdrew consent, unacceptable adverse effects arose, or disease progression occurred. Continuation of the study treatment or crossover after disease progression was not permitted. Study patients were stratified according to American Joint Committee on Cancer stage and geographic region. To manage adverse events, we allowed modifications to the dose of both vemurafenib and cobimetinib, with dose modifications for prespecified levels of toxic events (i.e., grade \u22652; see the study protocol).\n\n#### **STUDY END POINTS**\n\nThe primary end point was progression-free survival as assessed by the investigator, according to RECIST criteria, version 1.1. The secondary end points included overall survival, rate of confirmed objective response according to RECIST criteria, version 1.1, duration of response, progression-free survival as assessed by an independent review facility, and safety (assessed according to the study treatment received). Tumor assessments were carried out at baseline and every 8 weeks, and we performed a blinded, independent central review of tumor assessments.\n\n#### **STATISTICAL ANALYSIS**\n\nThe prespecified number of progression events (206 events) was reached in May 2014, and the results reported here are based on data analyses from July 2014 (database locked on July 10, 2014). All the efficacy analyses were carried out in the intention-to-treat population. We estimated that 206 progression events would provide the study with at least 95% power to detect a hazard ratio for death or progression of disease of 0.55, with an alpha level of 0.05 (an increase in the median progression-free survival, from 6 months for vemurafenib and placebo to 11 months for vemurafenib plus cobimetinib). Progression-free survival was defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of the first documented event of disease progression or death, whichever occurred first according to the assessment of the site investigator.\n\nWe used the Kaplan\u2013Meier method to estimate rates of progression-free and overall survival and used a stratified log-rank test for all the comparisons.

The median follow-up of patients at the time of reporting was 7.3 months (range, 0.5 to 16.5).\n\n#### **EFFICACY**\n\n#### *Progression-free Survival*\n\nThe combination of vemurafenib and cobimetinib significantly prolonged progression-free survival according to investigator assessment in the intention-to-treat population: a median of 9.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.0 to not reached), as compared with 6.2 months (95% CI, 5.6 to 7.4) in patients treated with vemurafenib and placebo. The hazard ratio for death or progression of disease was 0.51 (95% CI, 0.39 to 0.68; P<0.001) (Fig. 1A).

This assessment of overall survival was performed at the time of the final analysis of progression-free survival, and at this early time point, it had not crossed the prespecified hazard-ratio boundary for significance (observed hazard ratio for death, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.42 to 1.00; P=0.046; boundary P<0.0000037). The absolute number of deaths was 34 in the combination group and 51 in the control group, and the median overall survival was not reached in either study group.\n\n#### *Response*\n\nThe investigator-assessed response rate was significantly higher in the combination group than in the control group (Table 2). Overall, 68% of patients in the combination group had an objective response, as compared with 45% in the control group (P<0.001) (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The rate of complete response was also significantly higher in the combination group than in the control group (10% vs. 4%). The majority of responses were seen by the time of the first tumor assessment at 8 weeks (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). The median duration of response was 7.3 months in the control group, and the median was not reached in the combination group (Table 2).\n\n#### **SAFETY**\n\nA total of 493 patients (>99%) received at least one dose of study drug and were included in the safety analysis. Adverse events that were reported in at least 20% of patients in either group are shown in Table 3. The combination of vemurafenib and cobimetinib was associated with a higher frequency of certain events than the single-agent therapy, including central serous retinopathy, gastrointestinal events (diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting), photosensitivity, elevated aminotransferase levels, and an increased creatine kinase level; the majority (>50%) of these individual events were grade 1 or 2 (Table 3).\n\nWe observed equivalent rates of grade 3 events (49%) in the two study groups and substantially fewer grade 4 events (9% in the control group vs. 13% in the combination group), with close to\n\n![](_page_6_Figure_9.jpeg)\n\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\n\nDownloaded from nejm.org on June 16, 2025.

analyzed according to the study treatment received. Eight patients assigned to the control group received investigational cobimetinib as a result of dispensing errors. Two patients (one in each study group) did not receive the assigned study drug and were therefore excluded from the safety analysis. Multiple occurrences of a specific adverse event for a patient were counted once at the highest grade of the occurrence, according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. For example, if a patient had two episodes of a specific toxic event, one grade 3 and one grade 4, the patient was counted only once, in the grade 4 column. Similarly, in the \"Any adverse events\" row, if a patient had, for example, three separate events of grade 1, 3, and 4, the patient was counted only once, in the grade 4 column.\n\n\u2020 The most common adverse events were those that occurred in at least 20% of the patients in either study group.\n\nhalf of these in the experimental group being due to laboratory abnormalities (elevated aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and creatine kinase levels) but without symptoms. An elevated creatine kinase level, a known class effect of MEK blockade, was the single most common grade 4 event (4%) seen with the combination therapy, although the majority of events related to creatine kinase (66%) were grade 1 or 2.\n\nSome toxic events were observed at a lower frequency in the combination group than in the control group, including keratoacanthomas and cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma, alopecia, and arthralgias. Rates of clinically significant cardiac events (QT-interval prolongation and decreased ejection fraction) were low and similar in the two groups, as was pyrexia, with only four patients with grade 3 events (all in the combina-\n\n1874 n engl j med 371;20 nejm.org november 13, 2014\n\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\n\nDownloaded from nejm.org on June 16, 2025.

Despite differences between the two groups in the type and frequency of adverse events, the incidence of toxic events leading to the withdrawal from treatment was similar (12% in the control group and 13% in the combination group). At the time of the data cutoff, a total of 85 patients had died, primarily as a result of disease progression (96% of the deaths in the control group and 85% of those in the combination group were due to progression).\n\n# DISCUSSION\n\nThis phase 3 study showed an improvement in the response rate and in progression-free survival when cobimetinib was added to vemurafenib. Together with the results of a phase 3 trial comparing dabrafenib plus trametinib with dabrafenib alone,19 these findings provide clear evidence of the benefit of combined MEK and BRAF inhibition. The data combining BRAF and MEK inhibitor\u2013targeted therapies need to be put in context with the rapidly evolving melanoma-treatment landscape \u2014 namely, the development of immunotherapies that are based on checkpoint blockade with ipilimumab or anti\u2013programmed death 1 antibodies. Evidence suggests that these agents can lead to durable tumor responses in patients with metastatic melanoma, albeit with lower response rates than have been observed with BRAF and MEK inhibition.20-23\n\nThe primary end point of the hazard ratio for the risk of progression or death that we report for vemurafenib plus cobimetinib, as compared with vemurafenib alone, is significant. The data from the prespecified interim analysis of overall survival we report here are immature, reflecting analysis at the time of the planned analysis of progression-free survival, and they do not cross the boundary prespecified in the statistical analysis plan. Nevertheless, these early data are encouraging, although mature data are needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn. The consistency between both primary and secondary end points and subgroups is a strength of the current study, as was the performance of the control group, which was broadly consistent with prior randomized trials of BRAF inhibitors in both the response rate and median progression-free survival.3,4 It is possible that the intermittent dosing regimen of cobimetinib, resulting from the definition of the maximum tolerated dose in phase 1 testing,15 might have an effect on the outcomes of the combination with vemurafenib: preclinical data suggest that the intermittent blockade of oncogenic BRAF signaling might delay the development of acquired resistance.<sup>24</sup>\n\nThe majority of common toxic events seen with the combination of vemurafenib and cobimetinib were of grade 1 or 2 (Table 3). With relatively long-term treatment with vemurafenib and cobimetinib, it is important to distinguish side effects of the combination therapy (e.g., nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) that can be managed with appropriate supportive interventions. In this study, several MEK inhibitor\u2013specific toxic events were observed. An asymptomatic elevated creatine kinase level is a known class effect of MEK inhibition and was observed in 30% of patients with exposure to vemurafenib and cobimetinib in our study, the majority of events being grade 1 or 2 and rapidly reversible. MEK inhibitors are also associated with ocular conditions resembling central serous retinopathy,25,26 recently referred to in the literature as transient drug-induced retinopathy.<sup>26</sup> Consistent with previous reports, most cases (86%) of retinopathy in our study were grade 1 (clinically asymptomatic) or 2 (moderate decrease in visual acuity), were found to be reversible at subsequent ophthalmic examinations in the majority of cases without any treatment, or were managed with dose reduction or withdrawal of cobimetinib.\n\nIn conclusion, the combination of vemurafenib and cobimetinib, as compared with vemurafenib alone, resulted in an improvement in progression-free survival and objective responses, with early evidence of improved overall survival and a somewhat increased toxicity profile, among patients with advanced *BRAF*-mutated melanoma.\n\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\n\nWe thank the patients and their families for their participation.\n\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\n\nDownloaded from nejm.org on June 16, 2025.

This randomized phase 3 study evaluated the combination of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib and the MEK inhibitor cobimetinib.\n\n#### **METHODS**\n\nWe randomly assigned 495 patients with previously untreated unresectable locally advanced or metastatic *BRAF* V600 mutation\u2013positive melanoma to receive vemurafenib and cobimetinib (combination group) or vemurafenib and placebo (control group). The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival.\n\n#### **RESULTS**\n\nThe median progression-free survival was 9.9 months in the combination group and 6.2 months in the control group (hazard ratio for death or disease progression, 0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39 to 0.68; P<0.001). The rate of complete or partial response in the combination group was 68%, as compared with 45% in the control group (P<0.001), including rates of complete response of 10% in the combination group and 4% in the control group. Progression-free survival as assessed by independent review was similar to investigator-assessed progression-free survival. Interim analyses of overall survival showed 9-month survival rates of 81% (95% CI, 75 to 87) in the combination group and 73% (95% CI, 65 to 80) in the control group. Vemurafenib and cobimetinib was associated with a nonsignificantly higher incidence of adverse events of grade 3 or higher, as compared with vemurafenib and placebo (65% vs. 59%), and there was no significant difference in the rate of study-drug discontinuation. The number of secondary cutaneous cancers decreased with the combination therapy.\n\n### **CONCLUSIONS**\n\nThe addition of cobimetinib to vemurafenib was associated with a significant improvement in progression-free survival among patients with *BRAF* V600\u2013mutated metastatic melanoma, at the cost of some increase in toxicity.

For personal use only.\n\nApproximately 50% of metastatic cutaneous melanomas harbor a *BRAF* V600 mutation, resulting in constitutive activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.1,2 These discoveries led to the development of agents that specifically target this driver mutation. The BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (Zelboraf, Genentech) was approved worldwide on the basis of results from a phase 3 trial showing improved progression-free survival and overall survival, as compared with chemotherapy alone; the relative reduction in the risk of death was 63% and in the risk of disease progression was 74%.3 Similar results were also reported for another BRAF inhibitor, dabrafenib,4 which has also been approved widely. Although common toxic events with both agents are similar (rash, fatigue, and joint pain), the incidence of clinically significant photosensitivity is higher with vemurafenib, whereas the incidence of clinically significant pyrexia is higher with dabrafenib. A toxic event common to both is secondary cutaneous squamous-cell carcinomas and keratoacanthomas, which occur in approximately 14 to 26% of patients treated with a BRAF inhibitor, usually within the first 2 to 3 months of therapy.5,6 The skin tumors develop owing to a paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway in keratinocytes with upstream activation of signaling by preexisting *RAS* mutations,7,8 which can be blocked with the addition of a MEK inhibitor.<sup>8</sup>\n\nProgression after a period of tumor response (acquired resistance) is common with single-agent BRAF-inhibitor therapy after a median progression-free survival of 6 to 7 months.3,4 The mechanisms of acquired resistance are diverse and include the reactivation of oncogenic signaling by means of the MAPK pathway in approximately two thirds of cases and mechanisms that lead to MAPK pathway\u2013independent signaling that substitutes for the inhibited driver oncogenic signal within the MAPK pathway.9-11 The finding of multiple genetic mechanisms of escape in individual patients10 implies that upfront inhibition of both MEK and the mutant BRAF kinases might be a strategy for obtaining more durable responses than the inhibition of BRAF alone.\n\nPreclinical and clinical data suggest that the inhibition of both MEK and mutant BRAF kinases might result in a greater initial tumor response, prevent MAPK-driven acquired resistance, and decrease the frequency and severity of toxic events that occur owing to paradoxical MAPK-pathway activation from BRAF-inhibitor monotherapy. Trametinib, a MEK inhibitor, was approved for the treatment of *BRAF*-mutated metastatic melanoma as a single agent after an improvement in progression-free and overall survival was shown in a randomized trial12 and in combination with dabrafenib on the basis of improvement in progression-free survival.13 Cobimetinib (also known as GDC-0973 [Roche] or XL518 [Exelixis]) is an orally bioavailable, potent, and selective MEK inhibitor.14 The most common toxic events associated with single-agent use of cobimetinib in phase 1 testing were diarrhea, rash, fatigue, and edema; grade 3 or higher events included diarrhea, rash, and fatigue.\n\nCobimetinib in combination with vemurafenib was studied in patients with advanced *BRAF* V600\u2013mutated melanoma in a phase 1b study (BRAF Inhibitor in Melanoma [BRIM] 7).15 Dose escalation was stopped at the maximum tolerated single-agent dose of each drug, with daily dosing of vemurafenib and cobimetinib administered for 21 days, followed by 7 days off. At these doses, a confirmed objective response was noted in 55 of 63 patients (87%) who had never received a BRAF inhibitor, and the antitumor activity appeared to be favorable, as compared with historical single-agent vemurafenib activity.3 Common adverse events were similar to those observed with the single agents and included rash, diarrhea, photosensitivity, and hepatic-enzyme abnormalities, and as expected, the incidence of cutaneous secondary cancers was decreased. To confirm and build on these early data, we report on the primary end point of coBRIM, an international, multicenter, randomized phase 3 study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of cobimetinib combined with vemurafenib in previously untreated patients with advanced *BRAF*-mutated melanoma.\n\n# METHODS\n\n#### **PATIENTS**\n\nEligible patients were at least 18 years of age; had histologically confirmed unresectable, locally advanced stage IIIC or stage IV melanoma with a *BRAF* V600 mutation detected with the use of a real-time polymerase-chain-reaction assay (Cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test, Roche Molecular Systems); had measurable disease, according to\n\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\n\nDownloaded from nejm.org on June 16, 2025.

Patients with previously treated brain metastases were eligible if they had at least a 3-week history of stable disease.\n\n#### **STUDY OVERSIGHT**\n\nThe study was approved by the institutional review board or ethics committee at each participating institution and was conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. All the patients provided written informed consent. An independent data and safety monitoring committee conducted regular review and evaluation of the safety data.\n\nF. Hoffmann\u2013La Roche/Genentech sponsored the study. All the authors and their research teams collected the data. Representatives of the sponsor and the members of the study steering committee designed the study. Representatives of the sponsor confirmed the accuracy of the data and compiled the data for analysis. The analysis was performed in collaboration with the authors. All the authors had full access to the data and analyses pertinent for the compilation of this report.\n\nTwo of the academic authors wrote the first draft of the manuscript, which was reviewed, modified, and approved in its final version by all the authors. Editorial assistance that did not involve writing was provided by Apothecom and funded by the sponsor. All the authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data reported and for the fidelity of the study to the protocol (available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org).\n\n#### **RANDOMIZATION AND TREATMENT**\n\nFrom January 2013 through January 2014, we enrolled 495 patients at 135 sites in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, Russia, Turkey, and Israel. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive vemurafenib orally (at a dose of 960 mg twice daily) together with either placebo (control group) or cobimetinib (at a dose of 60 mg once daily for 21 days, followed by 7 days off) (combination group). The study treatment continued until patients withdrew consent, unacceptable adverse effects arose, or disease progression occurred. Continuation of the study treatment or crossover after disease progression was not permitted. Study patients were stratified according to American Joint Committee on Cancer stage and geographic region. To manage adverse events, we allowed modifications to the dose of both vemurafenib and cobimetinib, with dose modifications for prespecified levels of toxic events (i.e., grade \u22652; see the study protocol).\n\n#### **STUDY END POINTS**\n\nThe primary end point was progression-free survival as assessed by the investigator, according to RECIST criteria, version 1.1. The secondary end points included overall survival, rate of confirmed objective response according to RECIST criteria, version 1.1, duration of response, progression-free survival as assessed by an independent review facility, and safety (assessed according to the study treatment received). Tumor assessments were carried out at baseline and every 8 weeks, and we performed a blinded, independent central review of tumor assessments.\n\n#### **STATISTICAL ANALYSIS**\n\nThe prespecified number of progression events (206 events) was reached in May 2014, and the results reported here are based on data analyses from July 2014 (database locked on July 10, 2014). All the efficacy analyses were carried out in the intention-to-treat population. We estimated that 206 progression events would provide the study with at least 95% power to detect a hazard ratio for death or progression of disease of 0.55, with an alpha level of 0.05 (an increase in the median progression-free survival, from 6 months for vemurafenib and placebo to 11 months for vemurafenib plus cobimetinib). Progression-free survival was defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of the first documented event of disease progression or death, whichever occurred first according to the assessment of the site investigator.\n\nWe used the Kaplan\u2013Meier method to estimate rates of progression-free and overall survival and used a stratified log-rank test for all the comparisons. Response rates and 95% confidence intervals\n\nn engl j med 371;20 nejm.org november 13, 2014 1869\n\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\n\nDownloaded from nejm.org on June 16, 2025.

LDH denotes lactate dehydrogenase.\n\n\u2020 Race was determined by the investigator.\n\n\u2021 The data for patients from Russia and Turkey were included with those for Europe.\n\n\u00a7 An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance-status score of 0 indicates that the patient is fully active and able to carry on all performance without restriction and a score of 1 that the patient is restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature. One patient randomly assigned to receive vemurafenib and cobimetinib had an ECOG performance-status score of 1 at randomization but had an ECOG performance-status score of 2 (indicating the patient is ambulatory and capable of all self-care but is unable to carry out any work activities and is out of bed more than 50% of waking hours) after randomization but before the first dose was received.\n\n\u00b6The criteria of the American Joint Committee on Cancer for distant metastasis are as follows: M1a indicates metastases to skin, subcutaneous tissue, or distant lymph nodes; M1b metastases to lung; and M1c metastases to all other visceral sites or distant metastases to any site combined with an elevated serum LDH level.\n\n\u2016 After randomization, we characterized tumor DNA to identify specific V600 mutations using next-generation sequencing. Cases that could not be evaluated were those in which either no tumor sample was provided or sequencing could not be performed on the tissue provided.\n\n## **Figure 1 (facing page). Progression-free Survival in the Intention-to-Treat Population and Prespecified Subgroups.**\n\nPanel A shows Kaplan\u2013Meier estimates of progression-free survival (as assessed by the site investigators) in the intention-to-treat population. The tick marks indicate censored data, and the dashed line 50% survival. Panel B shows hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (error bars) for progression-free survival in prespecified subgroups of patients, according to various baseline characteristics. The data for patients from Russia and Turkey were included with those for Europe. The size of the blue boxes indicates the number of events, and the dashed line the hazard ratio for the risk of disease progression or death in the overall population. NR denotes not reached.\n\nare reported for the two study groups. Differences in the response rate between the two treatment groups were tested with the use of a chi-square test with Schouten correction.17 We used the Kaplan\u2013Meier method to calculate median and interquartile ranges to summarize the duration of response. Safety analyses included all the patients who had received at least one dose of a study drug.\n\nThe final analysis of overall survival will occur after 385 deaths are recorded, which we estimate will provide the study with 80% power to detect a hazard ratio for death of 0.75. Two interim analyses have been planned. The first interim analysis was performed at the time of the final analysis of progression-free survival, and the second interim analysis of overall survival will be triggered after 256 deaths have occurred. A Lan\u2013DeMets implementation of an O'Brien\u2013Fleming boundary function was used in the analysis of overall survival.<sup>18</sup>\n\nRESULTS\n\n# **PATIENTS**\n\nA total of 1049 patients were screened, and 495 patients with *BRAF* V600\u2013mutated metastatic melanoma were randomly assigned to receive vemurafenib and cobimetinib (247 patients) or vemurafenib and placebo (248) (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org). The most common reason for exclusion from the study was a negative test result for the *BRAF* V600 mutation.

The median follow-up of patients at the time of reporting was 7.3 months (range, 0.5 to 16.5).\n\n#### **EFFICACY**\n\n#### *Progression-free Survival*\n\nThe combination of vemurafenib and cobimetinib significantly prolonged progression-free survival according to investigator assessment in the intention-to-treat population: a median of 9.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.0 to not reached), as compared with 6.2 months (95% CI, 5.6 to 7.4) in patients treated with vemurafenib and placebo. The hazard ratio for death or progression of disease was 0.51 (95% CI, 0.39 to 0.68; P<0.001) (Fig. 1A). The benefit for progressionfree survival was evident in all the prespecified patient subgroups (Fig. 1B) and according to analysis by independent radiology central review (Table 2, and Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).\n\n| Table 2.

This assessment of overall survival was performed at the time of the final analysis of progression-free survival, and at this early time point, it had not crossed the prespecified hazard-ratio boundary for significance (observed hazard ratio for death, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.42 to 1.00; P=0.046; boundary P<0.0000037). The absolute number of deaths was 34 in the combination group and 51 in the control group, and the median overall survival was not reached in either study group.\n\n#### *Response*\n\nThe investigator-assessed response rate was significantly higher in the combination group than in the control group (Table 2). Overall, 68% of patients in the combination group had an objective response, as compared with 45% in the control group (P<0.001) (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The rate of complete response was also significantly higher in the combination group than in the control group (10% vs. 4%). The majority of responses were seen by the time of the first tumor assessment at 8 weeks (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). The median duration of response was 7.3 months in the control group, and the median was not reached in the combination group (Table 2).\n\n#### **SAFETY**\n\nA total of 493 patients (>99%) received at least one dose of study drug and were included in the safety analysis. Adverse events that were reported in at least 20% of patients in either group are shown in Table 3. The combination of vemurafenib and cobimetinib was associated with a higher frequency of certain events than the single-agent therapy, including central serous retinopathy, gastrointestinal events (diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting), photosensitivity, elevated aminotransferase levels, and an increased creatine kinase level; the majority (>50%) of these individual events were grade 1 or 2 (Table 3).\n\nWe observed equivalent rates of grade 3 events (49%) in the two study groups and substantially fewer grade 4 events (9% in the control group vs. 13% in the combination group), with close to\n\n![](_page_6_Figure_9.jpeg)\n\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\n\nDownloaded from nejm.org on June 16, 2025.

analyzed according to the study treatment received. Eight patients assigned to the control group received investigational cobimetinib as a result of dispensing errors. Two patients (one in each study group) did not receive the assigned study drug and were therefore excluded from the safety analysis. Multiple occurrences of a specific adverse event for a patient were counted once at the highest grade of the occurrence, according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. For example, if a patient had two episodes of a specific toxic event, one grade 3 and one grade 4, the patient was counted only once, in the grade 4 column. Similarly, in the \"Any adverse events\" row, if a patient had, for example, three separate events of grade 1, 3, and 4, the patient was counted only once, in the grade 4 column.\n\n\u2020 The most common adverse events were those that occurred in at least 20% of the patients in either study group.\n\nhalf of these in the experimental group being due to laboratory abnormalities (elevated aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and creatine kinase levels) but without symptoms. An elevated creatine kinase level, a known class effect of MEK blockade, was the single most common grade 4 event (4%) seen with the combination therapy, although the majority of events related to creatine kinase (66%) were grade 1 or 2.\n\nSome toxic events were observed at a lower frequency in the combination group than in the control group, including keratoacanthomas and cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma, alopecia, and arthralgias. Rates of clinically significant cardiac events (QT-interval prolongation and decreased ejection fraction) were low and similar in the two groups, as was pyrexia, with only four patients with grade 3 events (all in the combina-\n\n1874 n engl j med 371;20 nejm.org november 13, 2014\n\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\n\nDownloaded from nejm.org on June 16, 2025.

Despite differences between the two groups in the type and frequency of adverse events, the incidence of toxic events leading to the withdrawal from treatment was similar (12% in the control group and 13% in the combination group). At the time of the data cutoff, a total of 85 patients had died, primarily as a result of disease progression (96% of the deaths in the control group and 85% of those in the combination group were due to progression).\n\n# DISCUSSION\n\nThis phase 3 study showed an improvement in the response rate and in progression-free survival when cobimetinib was added to vemurafenib. Together with the results of a phase 3 trial comparing dabrafenib plus trametinib with dabrafenib alone,19 these findings provide clear evidence of the benefit of combined MEK and BRAF inhibition. The data combining BRAF and MEK inhibitor\u2013targeted therapies need to be put in context with the rapidly evolving melanoma-treatment landscape \u2014 namely, the development of immunotherapies that are based on checkpoint blockade with ipilimumab or anti\u2013programmed death 1 antibodies. Evidence suggests that these agents can lead to durable tumor responses in patients with metastatic melanoma, albeit with lower response rates than have been observed with BRAF and MEK inhibition.20-23\n\nThe primary end point of the hazard ratio for the risk of progression or death that we report for vemurafenib plus cobimetinib, as compared with vemurafenib alone, is significant. The data from the prespecified interim analysis of overall survival we report here are immature, reflecting analysis at the time of the planned analysis of progression-free survival, and they do not cross the boundary prespecified in the statistical analysis plan. Nevertheless, these early data are encouraging, although mature data are needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn. The consistency between both primary and secondary end points and subgroups is a strength of the current study, as was the performance of the control group, which was broadly consistent with prior randomized trials of BRAF inhibitors in both the response rate and median progression-free survival.3,4 It is possible that the intermittent dosing regimen of cobimetinib, resulting from the definition of the maximum tolerated dose in phase 1 testing,15 might have an effect on the outcomes of the combination with vemurafenib: preclinical data suggest that the intermittent blockade of oncogenic BRAF signaling might delay the development of acquired resistance.<sup>24</sup>\n\nThe majority of common toxic events seen with the combination of vemurafenib and cobimetinib were of grade 1 or 2 (Table 3). With relatively long-term treatment with vemurafenib and cobimetinib, it is important to distinguish side effects of the combination therapy (e.g., nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) that can be managed with appropriate supportive interventions. In this study, several MEK inhibitor\u2013specific toxic events were observed. An asymptomatic elevated creatine kinase level is a known class effect of MEK inhibition and was observed in 30% of patients with exposure to vemurafenib and cobimetinib in our study, the majority of events being grade 1 or 2 and rapidly reversible. MEK inhibitors are also associated with ocular conditions resembling central serous retinopathy,25,26 recently referred to in the literature as transient drug-induced retinopathy.<sup>26</sup> Consistent with previous reports, most cases (86%) of retinopathy in our study were grade 1 (clinically asymptomatic) or 2 (moderate decrease in visual acuity), were found to be reversible at subsequent ophthalmic examinations in the majority of cases without any treatment, or were managed with dose reduction or withdrawal of cobimetinib.\n\nIn conclusion, the combination of vemurafenib and cobimetinib, as compared with vemurafenib alone, resulted in an improvement in progression-free survival and objective responses, with early evidence of improved overall survival and a somewhat increased toxicity profile, among patients with advanced *BRAF*-mutated melanoma.\n\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\n\nWe thank the patients and their families for their participation.\n\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\n\nDownloaded from nejm.org on June 16, 2025.
